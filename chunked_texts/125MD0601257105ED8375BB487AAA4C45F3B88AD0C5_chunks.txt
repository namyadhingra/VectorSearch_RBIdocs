5. Data Formats for reporting of Credit Information The reporting of credit information by CIs to the CICs, shall be undertaken in standardised data formats as prescribed in Annex IV. These standardised data formats would be a non-proprietary reporting format and shall be known as “Uniform Credit Reporting Format” (UCRF) as denoted below: Form 1: Uniform Credit Reporting Format (Consumer) – for consumer segment. Form 2: Uniform Credit Reporting Format (Commercial) – for commercial segment Form 3: Uniform Credit Reporting Format (MFI) – for microfinance segment. 6. Submission of Data by CIs (1) Reporting of Credit Information by CIs (a) CIs shall submit data on credit information of its borrowers (including historical data) to all CICs.

(b) CICs and CIs shall keep the credit information collected/ maintained by them, updated regularly on a fortnightly basis (i.e., as on 15th and last day of the respective month) or at shorter intervals as mutually agreed upon between the CI and CIC. The fortnightly submission of credit information by CIs to CICs shall be ensured within seven (7) calendar days of the relevant reporting fortnight. CICs shall provide a list of CIs which are not adhering to the fortnightly data submission timelines to Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office at half yearly intervals (as on March 31 and September 30 each year) for information and monitoring purposes. (c) CIs shall ensure that the records submitted to CICs are updated regularly and that no instances of repayment, including that of the last instalment, are left unreported.

(d) The CICRA provides statutory backing for sharing of credit information by CIs with CICs subject to conditions stipulated therein. Therefore, with CICRA coming into force, the "consent clause" has become redundant and hence consent of the borrower prescribed vide Annexure-I and II of the circular DBOD.No.DL.BC.29/20.16.002/2002- 03 dated October 1, 2002 need not be insisted upon by banks. 8 (e) While reporting the credit information in the UCRF, among others, the guidelines mentioned in Annex V shall be adhered to by CIs. (2) Credit information reporting in respect of Self Help Group (SHG) members (a) CIs financing SHGs shall report the SHG member level data to CICs in the Uniform Credit Reporting Format (MFI) as mentioned in Annex IV. (b) The structure of the credit information in respect of SHG members to be collected and reported by CIs to CICs is mentioned at Annex VI. (3) Credit Information Reporting Mechanism subsequent to cancellation of licence or Certificate of Registration

(a) In case of cancellation of Certification of Registration (CoR)/ licence of a CI by RBI, either through voluntary submission or supervisory action, CICs shall insert a suitable disclaimer in the records of the CI’s borrowers to reflect non-updatability of the record due to closure of the CI in their CIR. (b) In order to address the challenges in updating credit information of borrowers of CI whose Certification of Registration (CoR)/ licence has been cancelled, CICs and CIs shall implement, before April 10, 2025, a credit information reporting mechanism subsequent to cancellation of licence/ CoR of banks/ NBFCs as given in Annex VII.

7. Data Validation by CICs and Rectification of Rejected Data (1) The CICs shall share with the CIs, the logic and validation processes involved in data acceptance, so that instances of data rejection are minimised. The reasons for rejection shall be parameterised by the CICs and circulated among the concerned CIs. (2) Rejection reports issued by CICs shall be simple and understandable so that they can be used for fixing reporting and data level issues by the CIs. (3) CIs shall rectify the rejected data and upload the same with the CICs within seven days of receipt of such rejection report. 9 (4) CICs shall undertake periodic exercises/checks, at least once in a quarter, to identify identifier inconsistencies in its database and share the findings of such identifier inconsistencies with the respective CIs for confirming the accuracy of the same. The list of CIs who do not respond in timely manner (say within a month) to such data cleansing exercises shall be sent to Department of Supervision, Central Office at half yearly intervals (as on March 31 and September 30) for information. Explanation: CICs shall not share the data received from CIs under CICRA for ascertaining identifier inconsistencies with its respective nodal authorities and also not make changes to its database without obtaining confirmation from the respective CIs.

8. Data Quality Index (1) CICs shall prepare and provide Data Quality Index (DQI) for Consumer, Commercial and Microfinance segments as given in Annex VIII, IX and X, respectively, for assessing the quality of data submissions by CIs to CICs and improving the same over a period of time. (2) CICs shall provide DQIs for the three reporting segments (Consumer, Commercial and Microfinance) in the form of numeric scores on a monthly basis to all member CIs. (3) DQI score for the Consumer segment shall be provided at CI level as an average of demographic and trade data scores and such DQI score shall be computed as an average of file level DQI scores of that CI. (4) DQI scores for Commercial and Microfinance segments shall also be provided at CI and file level. The DQI scores for Commercial and Microfinance segments at CI level shall be computed as weighted average of file level DQI scores of Commercial and Microfinance segments, respectively, of that CI. (5) CICs shall compute industry level DQIs for each of the three reporting segments as weighted average of the CI level DQI in their respective category (e.g. Public-Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks, Foreign Banks, Co-operative Banks, RRBs, NBFCs etc.) on monthly basis. Further, a half yearly Industry Benchmark shall be calculated as a rolling average of preceding six months Industry level DQI score of the respective category of CIs. 10 (6) CICs shall provide reasons for decline in score to each CI, if its (a) CI level score has declined over the previous month or (b) CI level score is lower than the half yearly industry benchmark. (7) CICs shall provide monthly data of CI level DQI and industry level DQI of all segments to Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office at half yearly intervals as on September 30 and March 31 each year, for information and monitoring purposes. (8) CIs are advised to undertake half yearly review of the DQI for all segments to improve the quality of the data being submitted to CICs. A report consisting of issues identified and corrective steps taken shall be placed before its top management by each CI for review within two months from the end of that half-year.

9. Credit Information dissemination by CICs (1) Credit Information Report (CIR) (a) It is not considered necessary to standardise the format of the CIR as some differentiation is essential for promoting competition in the market. However, CICs shall standardise the CIR terminology and also have some mandatory key fields. This would facilitate comparison between CIRs received from two or more CICs, by the users. (b) CICs shall provide a single credit information report (CIR) for one borrower, even if the firm/ person has more than one address, by utilising a unique identification number such as PAN number, Voter ID number, Passport number, Driving License number, etc., provided by the CI. (c) CICs shall capture details of co-borrowers and guarantors, wherever applicable, in the CIR. This would facilitate deciding on the extent of exposure a CI can consider on an entity. The CIR shall give details of the loans availed by the customers in their capacity as borrower/co-borrower/guarantor.

(d) In the case of multiple borrowings by the same customer, involving both current and closed accounts, the CICs shall provide information on various accounts in the order of live accounts, closed accounts and overall position of NPA status/ wilful default/ suit filed, with limits and liabilities for each account. 11 (e) CIR shall provide appropriate disclosures, if any information contained therein has been disputed and the matter has not been satisfactorily resolved. If the customer so desires, his/ her comment could also be added to the CIR. Certain fields pertaining to consumer disputes viz. dispute code, dispute description, dispute date and consumer comments on disputes (as listed in Annex 5 of the Aditya Puri Committee Report3) may be included in the CIR.

(f) Information relating to loans declined previously to customers shall not be reported by CICs, as such information could be prejudicial to the interests of the customer as rejection in one CI could be used as a ground for rejection of the same by another CI. (g) In addition to the existing CIR, the CICs may provide a comprehensive credit information report (CCIR) incorporating the credit information in respect of a borrower available in all the modules, i.e., the consumer, commercial and MFI, as an additional option for usage by CIs. This would provide the CIs with an option to consume either the CIR or the CCIR, based on their respective credit appraisal requirements. (h) To facilitate the understanding and interpretation of credit scores in an easy and consistent manner, the credit scores shall be calibrated from 300 to 900 by all CICs, so that they have a common classification of credit scores.

(i) The CICs shall provide access in an electronic format, upon request and after due authentication of the requester, to one free full credit report (FFCR) including credit score, once, at any time, during a year (January – December), to individuals whose credit score is available with them. FFCR shall show the latest position of the CIs exposure to the individual as per the records available with the CICs. The contents of the FFCR shall be the same as appearing in the most detailed version of the reports of the individual provided to CIs, including the credit score. CICs shall prominently display the link for accessing the FFCR on their website (on the homepage itself) so that individuals are able to access their FFCR conveniently. The CICs shall have a Board approved policy on making available the FFCR. 3 The Report of the Committee can be accessed through the link: https://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&ID=763 12

(j) The enquiry module of CICs for generation of CIRs shall have appropriate sub- fields (with not more than 5-7 options each) for the SUs to choose from while selecting the purpose of enquiry. Further, one of the sub-fields in the enquiry module of CICs shall be invariably designated as ‘Business Loan - Director Search - soft enquiry - score unaffected’. CICs shall conduct awareness programmes to sensitize SUs on the importance of choosing correct enquiry parameters and its implications. (2) Sharing of credit information with third party entities based on consent of individuals It is observed that the CICs are sharing credit information based on consent of an individual, with entities which are not SUs, by entering into an agreement with such entities. Given the sensitivity and possible misuse while sharing such credit information, the CICs shall put in place a suitable mechanism for the purpose.

(a) CICs shall put in place a robust due diligence and control mechanism while sharing credit information of an individual based on his/her consent with entities which are not specified users, by entering into agreement with such entities. This shall involve an evaluation of all the available information about the entity, including but not limited to the following: (i) The general character of management should not be prejudicial to public interest. (ii) Business reputation, ownership structure, compliance/ governance standards, grievance redressal mechanism and outstanding litigation. (iii) Financial soundness and ability to service commitments even under adverse conditions. (iv) Necessary technological, entrepreneurial and managerial resources to support the proposed activity of the customers over the contracted period. (v) Information security and internal control, audit coverage, monitoring and reporting environment and business continuity management. 13

(i) The entity, in its capacity as an authorized representative of the individual, shall use the CIR solely for the limited end use as agreed between them and shall not use or sell or resell or pass on information to any other person or engage itself in obtaining CIR other than for the consented purpose. "Individual Consent" means the prior written consent of the individual by any documented means, stored as an electronic or physical record verifiable from time to time and permanent in nature. (ii) The credit information shared by CICs with these entities is stored only for a limited time period of six months, or till such time the credit information is required to be retained to satisfy the purpose for which it was intended, or the individual withdraws his/her consent to store such credit information, whichever is earlier and thereafter, the stored credit information shall be deleted. If the purpose for which such credit information so obtained by the entities is not fulfilled, then these entities would be required to seek a fresh consent from the concerned individual for retaining credit information beyond a period of six months as stated above. The Information System auditor appointed for the purpose shall examine compliance to the above. (iii) There is no unauthorized use by any other third party including but not limited to any of its group companies, subsidiaries, affiliates or associates in violation of the provisions of CICRA, 2005 and other applicable laws. (iv) Such information is shared with its employees or agents on a ‘need to know basis’ only, while ensuring that such employees or agents with access to the said information are subjected to obligation of confidentiality.

(v) The credit information received is duly protected both online and offline against any unauthorized access or use, to ensure the confidentiality and security of all transactions except for disclosures made as agreed to between the entity and the individual. 14 (vi) The credit information received shall be processed and stored in India and not transferred outside India. (c) With respect to Information System (IS) Audit –

(i) The CICs shall incorporate a clause in their agreement that a CISA certified auditor appointed by the entity would conduct IS audit of the entities with whom CICs have entered into agreement for sharing of credit information based on consent of the individual and the IS audit reports in this regard shall be submitted to CICs. Such audit shall be undertaken annually or even earlier, if warranted. (ii) The scope of IS audit or appointed IS auditor would be to ensure that the entities are adhering to Section 19, 20 and 22 of CICRA, 2005 and Rules 18(b), 23, 28 and 29 of the CIC Rules, 2006 and are using the credit information for the permitted purposes. (iii) The IS audit reports and the review undertaken by the Board of the CIC shall be shared with the supervisory team of RBI.

(d) CICs while entering into an agreement with these entities may incorporate appropriate provisions in the contract/ agreement for enforcement of these guidelines. Violation of any clause of the agreement by the entities or any adverse observations of the IS auditor against the entities would warrant CICs to initiate stringent action which may include, inter alia, termination of the agreement.

10. Correction of Credit Information Report (1) CIs and CICs shall abide by the time periods stipulated under CICRA and the Rules and Regulations framed thereunder in respect of updation, alteration of credit information, resolving disputes, etc. Procedure prescribed under Rules 20, 21, 25 and 26 of the CIC Rules, 2006 in this regard shall be adhered to. Deviations from stipulated time limits shall be monitored and commented upon in the periodical reports/reviews put up to the Board/ Committee of Board on customer service. (2) The CIs as well as the CICs shall have arrangements in place to receive customer requests for rectification of data in CIRs. In order to maintain high data quality, all 15 erroneous data shall be corrected at the source by the CI that originally submitted the data. The CIC shall not change borrower data unless the CI submitting the data has rectified it at the source to obviate the risk of updated data being overwritten by erroneous data in the next submission cycle by the CI. (3) The CICs shall provide a special ‘view’ / ‘read only’ access to the member CIs to view account level updates in their database through a front-end interface to enable CIs to confirm or upload account updates/ correction requests and also in speedy resolving of discrepancies in CIRs. The CICs shall operationalise a full-fledged online data correction mechanism, in the interest of customer service. (4) In case any correction is carried out in the CIR, the CICs shall provide a free copy of the corrected report to whom the report had been issued during the previous six months. However, the cost of the CIR may be borne by the members of CICs, if they are responsible for the inaccurate data.

11. Use of credit information reports in credit appraisal (1) The CIs shall include in their loan policies/ credit appraisal processes, suitable provisions for obtaining CIRs from one or more CICs so that the credit decisions are based on credit information available in the system. (2) CICs should regularly hold workshops for CIs, in association with Indian Banks Association (IBA) or Micro Finance Institutions Network (MFIN)/ Sa-Dhan, as the case may be, for creating awareness about use of CIRs in credit appraisal and in better screening of loan applicants.

12. Display of information by CIs4 CIs, which are secured creditors as per the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002, shall display, on their website, information in respect of the borrowers whose secured assets have been taken into possession by the CIs under the SARFAESI Act, 2002 as per the 4 Frequently asked questions (FAQs) on this aspect are available on the following link: https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=163 16 format given in Annex XI.

17. Framework for compensation to customers for delayed updation/ rectification of credit information CICs and CIs are directed to implement the following compensation mechanism for delayed updation/ rectification of credit information: (1) Complainants shall be entitled to a compensation of ₹100 per calendar day in case their complaint is not resolved within a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the initial filing of the complaint by the complainant with a CI/ CIC. Explanation: (a) Section 21 (3) of CICRA, 2005 provides that a complainant may request a CIC or CI to update the credit information by making an appropriate correction, addition or otherwise, and on such request the CI or CIC shall take steps to update the credit information within thirty (30) days after being requested to do so.

(b) Rule 20 (3) (c) of CIC Rules, 2006 provides that the CI shall forward the corrected particulars of the credit information to the CIC or complainant within a period of twenty-one (21) days from the date when the CI was informed of the inaccuracy in the credit information.

(c) The combined reading of Section 21(3) of CICRA, 2005 and Rule 20 (3) (c) of CIC Rules, 2006 provide the CI and the CIC, collectively, an overall limit of thirty (30) days to resolve/ dispose of the complaint. In effect, this would mean that a CI would get twenty-one (21) days and CICs would effectively get the remainder of nine (9) days for complete resolution of the complaint. (2) A CI shall pay compensation to the complainant if the CI has failed to send updated credit information to the CICs by making an appropriate correction or addition or 22 otherwise within twenty-one (21) calendar days of being informed by the complainant or a CIC. (3) A CIC shall pay compensation to the complainant if the CIC has failed to resolve the complaint within thirty (30) calendar days of being informed by the complainant or a CI, despite the CI having furnished the updated credit information to the CIC within twenty-one (21) calendar days of being informed by the complainant or the CIC. (4) The complainant shall be advised by the CI/ CIC of the action taken on the complaint in all cases, including the cases where the complaint has been rejected. In cases of rejection, the reasons for rejection shall also be provided by CI and CIC. (5) Compensation to be provided by the CICs/ CIs to the complainant (for delayed resolution beyond thirty (30) calendar days of filing the complaint) shall be apportioned among the CIs/ CICs concerned proportionately. Illustrative examples of the same are given in Annex XIII. (6) Where the grievance/ complaint involves inaccurate credit information provided by more than one CI, the complaint shall be registered by the complainant with the concerned CIC. The CIC shall coordinate with all the CIs concerned and furnish the complainant with a comprehensive resolution of the grievance. (7) Where the complaint has been received and registered by a CIC and there has been a delay in the resolution of the complaint, the CIC shall inform the concerned CI(s) and the complainant after the final resolution, regarding total delay (in calendar days) and the amount of compensation to be paid by the CI(s) and/ or CIC. (8) Where the complaint has been received and registered by a CI and there has been a delay in the resolution of the complaint, the CI shall inform the concerned CIC(s) and the complainant after the final resolution, regarding total delay (in calendar days) and the amount of compensation to be paid by the CI and/ or CIC(s). (9) The date of the resolution of the grievance shall be the date when the rectified CIR has been sent by the CIC or CI to the postal address or email ID provided by the complainant. 23 (10) The CICs/ CIs shall make appropriate provision in their complaint submission format (both online and offline) for enabling the complainant to submit the contact details, email ID, and bank account details/ Unified Payment Interface (UPI) ID for crediting the compensation amount. The onus of providing accurate details will lie with the complainant and the CIs/ CICs will not be held responsible for any incorrect information provided by the complainant. (11) The compensation amount shall be credited to the bank account of the complainant within five (5) working days of the resolution of the complaint. (12) The complainant can approach RBI Ombudsman, under the Reserve Bank - Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021, in case of wrongful denial of compensation by CIs or CICs. (13) In case of wrongful denial of compensation by CIs which are yet to be covered under the Reserve Bank - Integrated Ombudsman Scheme, 2021, the complainant can approach Consumer Education and Protection Cell (CEPC) functioning from Regional Offices (ROs) of Reserve Bank of India. (14) The compensation framework shall not be applicable in the following cases:

(a) disputes for which remedy has been provided under Section 18 of CICRA, 2005. The Section 18 of CICRA, 2005 provides that for disputes arising amongst, CICs, CIs, borrowers, and clients on matters relating to the business of credit information and for which no remedy has been provided under CICRA, 2005, such disputes shall be settled by conciliation or arbitration as provided in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. (b) complaints/ references relating to (i) internal administration, (ii) human resources, (iii) pay and emoluments of staff, and (iv) references in the nature of suggestions and commercial decisions of the CIC/CI.

18. Miscellaneous Instructions CICs shall share with the complainant, if he/she desires, the details of action taken with respect to their complaint, the relevant correspondences/follow-up done with the CIs and the reply received from CIs.

(i) In the commercial reporting segment, corporate identification number (CIN) and credit history of the directors of the company (based on DIN number) shall be reported by CIs to CICs and included by the CICs in their reports. (ii) CIs shall report cases where compromise settlements have taken place and the reason for such compromise settlement, in the prescribed data formats to CICs. (iii) With respect to part instalment overdue, the CIs shall submit data as it is, while qualitative information on what filters to apply based on amount and period would be done by the SU and others who make use of the data. (iv) The CIs shall use 'settled' status for denoting only specific situations where due to financial inability to repay as per original terms and conditions, either a principal or an interest waiver or both is provided to the customer. CIs need to be aware of such a situation prior to extending fresh credit to such customers. Cases of wrong debits or contested charges shall not be reported as 'settled' but as 'disputed'.

(v) The information on Commercial Papers (CPs) issued by the companies shall be reported on a fortnightly basis to the CICs by the bank which has been designated as the Issuing and Payment Agent (IPA) for the particular CP issue. If there are multiple IPAs for a single CP issue, each IPA to such issue shall report to the CICs the details pertaining to the portion of the issue which is with them. This information shall be reported in the commercial data format in the fields as mentioned in Appendix-1 to this Annex. The IPA shall also report any default in the redemption of the relevant CP issue to the CICs. In view of reporting requirement of IPA, it is clarified that investing CIs need not report the information on CPs to the CICs. (vi) The information regarding Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure (UFCE) of individual borrowers shall be reported on a fortnightly basis to the CICs by the lending bank (in the case of solo lenders)/ consortium leader (in the case of consortium arrangements)/ largest lender (in the case of multiple lending arrangements). 60 (vii) The Committee set up to Recommend Data Format for furnishing of Credit Information to CICs (Chairman: Shri Aditya Puri) in its Report9 had recommended certain additional fields for inclusion in the data format in Annex 5 of the Report. CICs may incorporate the additional fields contained in the Annex 5 of the Report, except for priority sector indicator field, in the Consumer Data format. For vehicles, only vehicle make and registration number would be compulsory and not the chassis number. The registration number of property registered with Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) shall be added by the CICs. (viii) The cases admitted with National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT)/ National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 shall be reported under the suit-filed cases in the Uniform Credit Reporting Format, while reporting to the CICs. (ix) The Relationship Segment (RS) details are important in establishing cross-linkages across the three modules, viz., Consumer, Commercial and MFI, while providing comprehensive credit information of a borrower to CIs by CICs. The reporting of RS data by CIs to CICs is mandatory for all accounts opened on or after July 01,

2018. A timeline for reporting of the remainder legacy data would be reviewed by the Technical Working Group (TWG) and the CIs would be advised in due course. CICs shall furnish the list of CIs not adhering to the instructions on reporting of RS data to the Department of Supervision (DoS), Central office, on a monthly basis in the format mentioned in Appendix-2 to this Annex. Explanation: The reporting of shareholders’ information under the ‘relationship’ field of the Relationship Segment in the Commercial data format should be done only for those shareholders who are ‘Beneficial Owners’ as defined under the Master Direction – Know your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016 dated February 25, 2016, as amended from time to time. 9 The Report of the Committee can be accessed through the link: https://rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?UrlPage=&ID=763 61

(x) Guidelines for cross reporting, e.g., where individual is borrower and corporate is co- borrower, or vice versa, shall be clearly intimated by CICs. The formats have fields to incorporate the data where consumer data will be reported in the consumer data format and co-borrower will be reported in commercial data format. (xi) There shall be only one software format for uploading and reverting reject data from the CICs, as conversions/ reconversions between formats like Excel/TUDF/Notepad, etc., during the process of furnishing data, create validation issues. The Technical Working Group may further deliberate on this issue and make suitable suggestions, if considered necessary to RBI in this regard. 62 Appendix-1 Format for reporting information on Commercial Papers to Credit Information Companies Update in the description "CP" proposed Available Field in Commercial column of the format, in Fields Data Submission format case of commercial paper Name of CP issuer BS Segment - Field No. 4.

1. The structure of the credit information in respect of SHG members to be collected and reported by CIs to the CICs is set out below. 1 Information to be collected by CIs from individual Appendix 3 SHG members where the total amount of loan to be Table 1 attributed to or to be availed by the SHG member exceeds Rs.30,000/- 2 Information to be collected by CIs from individual Table 2 SHG members where the total amount of loan to be attributed to or to be availed by the SHG member is upto Rs.30,000/- 3 Information on all individual SHG members to be Table 3 reported by CIs to CICs [included under the Uniform Credit Reporting (MFI) format] 4 Information on individual SHG members to be Table 4 collected by banks at the time of opening of new Savings Bank Accounts of the SHG

2. Data formats and reporting instructions (1). The data tables are given in Appendix 3. As indicated above, CIs shall collect information from all SHG members in Tables 1 and 2 and report it to the CICs as set out in Table 3. The SHG member level data as mentioned in Table 3 shall be subsumed in Form 3: Uniform Credit Reporting format (MFI) of Annex IV for reporting to CICs. The tables have been designed based on the following considerations: (a) Some of the information (Item number 17 of Tables 1 and 2) is related to the existing exposures of the SHG members including that of the SHG groups with whom they might have been previously associated. This is intended to help CIs make informed credit decisions with regard to the SHG members. This information may be collected by CIs directly from the CICs based on lead information provided by the SHG members. Hence, there would be no need for CIs to include this information in the dataset reported to the CICs as per Table 3.

(b) The collection and reporting of credit information in respect of SHG members will be restricted to the members of those SHGs that take loans exceeding ₹ 1,00,000/-. However, the members of all SHGs, regardless of the amount of group loan, shall report the non-credit information to CIs through the SHG Group at the time when the SHG approaches the CI for a loan. 65

(c) The non-credit information requirements have been designed both from the perspective of identification of the individual borrowers and supplementing the information requirements of banks, regulatory and government development agencies for the purpose of evaluating the flow of credit to various sub-segments of the SHG members and designing suitable credit penetration strategies keeping in view the socio-economic profile of the sub-segments. The information shall be reported by CIs to the CICs in a manner that allows the CICs to identify all members associated with a particular SHG and a particular person to be identified with all SHGs with whom he/she is/was associated. (2). CIs shall put in place necessary systems and procedures including making necessary changes to their system software for collections of the relevant information from the SHG members and reporting the required information to the CICs. (3). CIs have the option to collect and report the SHG member level data either themselves or by outsourcing it to other entities. However, CIs shall follow all general instructions on outsourcing set out in the circulars DBOD.No.BP.40/21.04.158/2006- 07 dated November 3, 2006 and DOR.ORG.REC.27/21.04.158/2021-22 dated June 28, 2021, as amended from time to time, to the extent applicable and shall continue to be responsible for the correctness of the data submitted by the outsourced agencies to the CICs. CIs must put in place appropriate controls to ensure the correctness of the data submitted by the entities to which it is outsourced. (4). CIs shall monitor the NPA levels in the SHG segment on an ongoing basis and collect detailed information from SHG members availing loans exceeding a lower threshold of ₹ 20,000, if the Gross NPA in the SHG segment exceeds 10% or is higher than the gross NPA of the CI by 5 percentage points. (5). Non-adherence to the instructions by CIs shall result in exclusion of non-compliant SHG loan accounts from the loan portfolios eligible to be reckoned for the purpose of complying with the priority sector lending (PSL) targets.

3. Other operational instructions (1). At this stage, it is envisaged to capture details of only the credit facilities availed by the SHG members from the CIs. Therefore, any information relating to inter-loaning among the SHG members out of their own savings will not be covered. However, in 66 order to know the overall indebtedness of a SHG member it may be necessary to know their exposures to the SHGs with regard to inter-loaning as well. As part of the continued endeavour to improve the quality of information of a SHG member, the need for capturing the inter-loaning would be reviewed in due course. (2). Given significant challenges in monitoring and reporting the performance of individual loans availed by the SHG members out of the amounts lent by CIs to the SHGs, it is not envisaged to extend the credit reporting system to the monitoring of repayment and recovery of these loans. However, this would be considered in due course. (3). With a view to building up the adequate information base of the potential SHG member borrowers, and expediting the process of collection and reporting of KYC compliant information relating to the members of the SHGs when the SHGs are credit- linked, banks are encouraged to offer Small Accounts/ Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account to the SHG members when an SHG approaches them for opening a Savings Account. In cases where the SHG members agree to open such accounts, the information in Table 4 may be collected and kept on record to be used at the time when the SHG approaches the bank for a loan. However, it must not be made a pre-condition for opening the Savings Account of the SHG. (4). None of the data requirements specified in this Annex should be made a pre- condition for extending loans to the SHGs, though CIs must make sincere efforts to comply with these requirements. (5). CIs may encourage the SHGs to keep written records of loans distributed to their members out of the loan availed including the digitisation scheme for SHGs of NABARD, where applicable, and may consider introducing appropriate incentives in this regard. (6). CIs shall develop appropriate policies to deal with applications for credit facilities from members of SHGs/SHGs on whom default is reported by the CICs. Care needs to be taken that the SHGs/individual members are not denied loans merely because of such defaults and CIs should appropriately evaluate the credit history of the members themselves and take into account the economic viability of their activities and the Groups’ capacity to service the loan proposed to be taken by considering their loan applications. 67 (7). The credit information relating to individual SHG members shall be collected, reported and disseminated as per the provisions of the CICRA and the extant RBI directions on credit information reporting by CIs.

4. Specific instructions to the CICs (1). The CICs shall make the necessary changes in their systems and procedures to implement the above directions. (2). CICs shall formulate appropriate policies with the approval of their Boards to share the credit information relating to SHGs or SHG members, on an aggregate basis with the Government agencies, NABARD, banks and MFIs for the purpose of credit planning and research. In accordance with their board approved policies, the CICs could also share the aggregate information with other parties for the purpose of undertaking research that could potentially benefit the SHG segment. The aggregate information shall be shared in a manner that is non-discriminatory and respects the confidentiality of the individual SHG groups and the SHG members as per the relevant laws of the country. 68 Appendix -3 Indicative Data Formats for collection of individual SHG members10 Table 1: Information to be collected from individual SHG members where the total amount of loan to be attributed to or to be availed by the SHG member exceeds ₹30, 00011 Particulars required Particulars Basis provided I.

The actual distribution of the loan to individual members wherever it was agreed to be above Rs. 30,000 or where the actual amount disbursed exceeded Rs.30000 though not agreed at the time of taking loan from the CI, must be reported to the CI by the SHG office bearers. Non-adherence to this condition may be taken into account while extending further loan to the SHG or renewing its cash credit limit next time. The CIs need to incorporate suitable clauses in the loan agreements relating to penal provisions for providing wrong information regarding the amount of loans taken out of the group loans. Depending upon their experience, CIs may also insist on maintenance of verifiable record of the amounts distributed out of CI loans in cases where the average amount of loan availed by the SHG per member exceeds Rs.20,000/. 71 Table 2: Information to be collected from individual SHG members where the total amount of loan to be attributed to or to be availed by the SHG member is upto ₹30,00017 Particulars required Particulars Basis provided I.

Complaints registered with CIC by the complainant CIs have maximum 21 days’ time and CICs have the remaining period, within the overall time period of 30 days from the date of receipt of the complaint for its resolution. Compensation payable by the CICs/ CIs shall be calculated under various scenarios as illustrated below. Case 1 • Complaint registered with a CIC on January 1, 2022. • The CIC seeks confirmation from the CI (for e.g. Bank A) on January 12, 2022. • Bank A provides confirmation to the CIC on February 2, 2022 (21st day would be February 2, 2022) – no delay by Bank A. • The CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 3,

2022. • Compensation of ₹300 shall be provided by the CIC to the complainant for delay of 3 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). Case 2 • Complaint registered with a CIC on January 1, 2022 • The CIC seeks confirmation from Bank A on January 5, 2022 • Bank A provides confirmation to the CIC on January 26, 2022 (i.e. within 21 days) – no delay by Bank A. • The CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 3, 2022 • Compensation of ₹300 shall be provided by the CIC to the complainant for delay of 3 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). Case 3 • Complaint registered with a CIC on January 1, 2022 • The CIC seeks confirmation from Bank A on January 5, 2022 88 • Bank A provides confirmation to the CIC on January 28, 2022 (21st day would be January 26, 2022) – 2 days delay by Bank A. • If CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 2, 2022 - Compensation of ₹200 shall be provided by the Bank A to the complainant for a delay of 2 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). • If CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 3, 2022 – Total compensation of ₹300 [₹200 by Bank A and ₹100 by CIC] shall be provided to the complainant for delay of 3 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). Case 4 • Complaint registered with a CIC on January 1, 2022 • The CIC seeks confirmation from Bank A, Bank B, Bank C, Bank D, Bank E on January 5, 2022 – i.e. the CIC has taken 4 days to seek confirmation. • For Bank A, B, C, D and E – (21st day would be January 26, 2022) • If Bank A provides confirmation to CIC on January 26, 2022 – No delay • If Bank B provides confirmation to CIC on January 31, 2022 – 5 days delay 32 • If Bank C provides confirmation to CIC on February 2, 2022 – 7 days delay days • If Bank D provides confirmation to CIC on February 4, 2022 – 9 days delay • If Bank E provides confirmation to CIC on February 6, 2022 – 11 days delay • Therefore, total delay in resolution of complaint is as follows: • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 6, 2022 – Total compensation of ₹600 shall be provided to the complainant, on a weighted average basis, as under, for a delay of 6 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022): Explanation: The delay of six days shall be apportioned by the CIs/CICs on weighted average of the extent of delay by each CIs/CICs. In the above case, the overall delay is 6 days and therefore the complainant shall be entitled for total compensation of ₹600. This needs to be apportioned between all the defaulting banks (in this case Bank B, C, D and E). Cumulatively, the delay of all the defaulting banks put together is 32 days (5+7+9+11 days). Therefore, the compensation 89 amount of ₹600 shall be apportioned on weighted average of the delay by each CIs in relation to the overall delay of 32 days in this case.  Bank A = No compensation  Bank B = (5*600)/32 = ₹93.75  Bank C= (7*600)/32 = ₹131.25  Bank D = (9*600)/32 = ₹168.75  Bank E = (11*600)/32 = ₹206.25  CIC = No compensation • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 11, 2022, total days taken by CIC would be 9 days (i.e. 4+ 5 days). Total compensation of ₹1100 shall be provided to the complainant, on a weighted average basis, as under, for delay of 11 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022):  Bank A = No compensation  Bank B = (5*1100)/32 = ₹171.88  Bank C = (7*1100)/32 = ₹240.62  Bank D = (9*1100)/32 = ₹309.38  Bank E = (11*1100)/32 = ₹378.12  CIC = No compensation (as CIC has taken overall 9 days) • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 15,

2022. CIC has taken 13 days (i.e. 4 days + 9 days) to provide a final rectified CIR. Total compensation of ₹1500 shall be provided to the complainant, on a weighted average basis as under, for the delay of 15 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022):  Bank A = No compensation  Bank B = (5*1500)/36 = ₹208.34  Bank C = (7*1500)/36 = ₹291.66 32 + 4 = 36  Bank D = (9*1500)/36 = ₹375.00 days  Bank E = (11*1500)/36 = ₹458.34

 CIC = (4*1500)/36 = ₹166.66 90 Case 5 • Complaint registered with a CIC on January 1, 2022 • The CIC seeks confirmation from Bank A on January 5, 2022 • Bank A provides confirmation to the CIC on January 28, 2022 (21st day would be January 26, 2022) – 2 days delay. • If, CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on January 31, 2022 (i.e. resolution done within 30 days of receiving the complaint) - No case for Compensation26. B. Complaints registered with CIs by the complainant Case 6 • Complaint registered with a CI27 (for e.g. Bank A) on January 1, 2022 • Bank A provides rectified details to CIC on January 22, 2022 (21st day would be January 22, 2022) – no delay by Bank A. • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on January 31, 2022 and Bank A provides the rectified CIR to the complainant on January 31, 2022 – No case for compensation. • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on January 31, 2022 and Bank A provides the rectified CIR to the complainant on February 1, 2022 – A compensation of ₹100 shall be provided by the Bank A to the complainant for delay of 1 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on February 1, 2022 and Bank A provides the rectified CIR to the complainant on February 1, 2022 - A compensation of ₹100 shall be provided by the CIC to the complainant for delay 26 However, the CI would be liable for penal action as deemed fit by the Reserve Bank of India as per provisions of CICRA, 2005 and Rules and Regulations farmed thereunder. 27 Where the grievance/ complaint involves inaccurate credit information of more than one (1) CI, the complaint shall be registered by the customer with the concerned CIC. The CIC shall coordinate with all CIs concerned, and furnish to the customer a comprehensive resolution of grievance. 91 of 1 day beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on February 1, 2022 and Bank A provides the rectified CIR to the complainant on February 2, 2022 - Total compensation of ₹200 shall be provided [₹100 by the CIC and ₹100 by Bank A] to the complainant for delay of 2 day beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). Case 7 • Complaint registered with a CI (for e.g. Bank A) on January 1, 2022 • Bank A resolves and provides rectified details to the CIC on January 25, 2022 (21st day would be January 22, 2022) – 3 days delay by Bank A. • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on January 31, 2022 and Bank A provides rectified CIR to complainant on January 31, 2022 - No case for Compensation. • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on February 3, 2022 (i.e. the CIC takes 9 days after being informed by Bank A) and Bank A provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 3, 2022 – A compensation of ₹300 shall be provided by Bank A to the complainant for delay of 3 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on February 3, 2022 and Bank A provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 4, 2022 – A compensation of ₹400 shall be provided by Bank A to the complainant for delay of 4 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on February 4, 2022 and Bank A provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 4, 2022 – Total compensation of ₹400 [₹100 by the CIC and ₹300 by Bank A] shall be provided to the complainant for delay of 4 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). 92 • If the CIC resolves and provides rectified CIR to Bank A on February 4, 2022 and Bank A provides rectified CIR to the complainant on February 5, 2022 – Total compensation of ₹500 [₹100 by CIC and ₹400 by Bank A] shall be provided to the complainant for delay of 5 days beyond the permissible period of 30 days (i.e. in this case by January 31, 2022). 93 Annex – XIV: Best Practices for CIs (1) Instances of non-updation of repayment information could be avoided by centralising the issue of no objection certificates (NOCs) and providing information to CICs. (2) Customer grievance redressal should be given top priority especially in respect of complaints relating to updation/ alteration of credit information. (3) Grievance redressal in respect of credit information should be integrated with the existing systems for grievance redressal. Aspects relating to customer grievances pertaining to credit information may also be an integral part of customer service policy of CIs. (4) CIs should give full customer information to the CICs. For instance, identifier information like PAN number, Voters ID Card number, etc. is not provided by CIs for all records. (5) First time borrowers’ loan applications should not be rejected just because they have no credit history. (6) With a view to decreasing court cases involving CIs and CICs, complaints need to be addressed by them on an urgent basis. CIs should have a structured process of complaint redressal for which a Consumer Protection Committee under the Board should be constituted. 94 Annex - XV: Best Practices for CICs (1) CICs should have a structured and systematic process for redressing customer grievance redressal. (2) CICs should have a nodal officer for dealing with customer complaints. (3) Following a dispute regarding a CIR, if it is established that the reason for the dispute lies with the CIC itself or with the information provided by a member CI to the CIC, the CIC may provide a free copy of the same type of CIR to the customer after correction of the credit information. (4) CICs shall compile the data on complaints on a quarterly basis and a quarterly review on complaints should be put up to the Board of Directors. (5) Trainings should be organised by the CICs for member CIs in order to make them understand the formats, importance of data reporting and how to improve data acceptance ratio. (6) Safeguards in respect of data usage in terms of Rule 27 of the CIC Rules by SUs should be built into the agreements with the SUs. (7) Whenever CIRs on the same borrower are accessed by more than one CI simultaneously, within a period of one month, an alert may be provided by the CIC to all the CIs who have drawn the reports to avoid multiple financing for the same purpose/ fraudulent transactions. (8) Alerts on borrowers who are changing their addresses/offices are to be indicated to other credit grantors without disclosing the name of the CIs. (9) Behaviour pattern of the borrowers, viz., frequency of loans obtained, frequency of CIs approached etc., may be provided as a separate value added product by CICs. (10) Customisation of reports as per the specific requirement of a SU may be done as a separate value-added product by CICs. 95 (11) CIs and CICs should ensure that the credit records of borrowers are regularly updated by CIs and that issues such as repayment of the last instalment of a loan does not get reported, does not arise. (12) CICs should be ISO 27001 certified for Information Security. (13) With a view to decreasing court cases involving CIs and CICs, complaints need to be addressed by them on an urgent basis. CICs shall have a structured process of complaint redressal for which a Consumer Protection Committee under the Board should be constituted. 96 Annex - XVI: List of Circulars repealed with the issuance of Master Direction Sr Circular No. Date Subject No 1 DBOD.No.DL.11590/20.16.034/20 27.02.2008 Credit Information Companies 07-08 (Regulation) (Removal of Difficulties) Order, 2008 2 DBOD.No.DL.BC.138/20.16.042/2 24.06.2009 Access to own credit Report 008-09 3 RPCD.CO.RRB.No.32/03.05.33/20 20.10.2009 Credit Information Companies 09-10 (Reg
