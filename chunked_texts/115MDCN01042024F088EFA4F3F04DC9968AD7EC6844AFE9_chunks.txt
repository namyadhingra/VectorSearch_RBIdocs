1. Authority to Impound Counterfeit Notes The Counterfeit Notes can be impounded by: (i) All banks (ii) Issue Offices of RBI 2. Detection of Counterfeit Notes 2.1 Banknotes tendered over the counter shall be examined for authenticity through machines. Similarly, banknotes received directly at the back office / currency chest through bulk tenders shall also be examined through machines. 2.2 No credit to customer’s account is to be given for Counterfeit Notes, if any, detected in the tender received over the counter or at the back-office / currency chest. 2.3 In no case, the Counterfeit Notes shall be returned to the tenderer or destroyed by the bank branches. Failure of the banks to impound Counterfeit Notes detected at their end will be construed as wilful involvement of the bank concerned in circulating Counterfeit Notes and penalty will be imposed. 3. Impounding of Counterfeit Notes Notes determined as counterfeit shall be stamped as "COUNTERFEIT NOTE" and impounded in the prescribed format (Annex I). Each such impounded note shall be recorded under authentication, in a separate register.

4. Issue of Receipt to Tenderer When a banknote tendered at the counter of a bank branch / back office and currency chest is found to be counterfeit, an acknowledgement receipt in the prescribed format (Annex II) must be issued to the tenderer, after stamping the note as in paragraph 3 ibid. The receipt, in running serial number, shall be authenticated by the cashier and tenderer. Notice to this effect shall be displayed prominently at the offices / branches for information of the public. The receipt is to be issued even in cases where the tenderer is unwilling to countersign it. 2 5. Detection of Counterfeit Notes – Reporting to Police and other bodies The following procedure shall be followed while reporting incidence of detection of Counterfeit Notes to the Police: 5.1 For cases of detection of Counterfeit Notes up to four (04) pieces in a single transaction, a consolidated report in the prescribed format (Annex III) shall be sent by the Nodal Bank Officer to the police authorities or the Nodal Police Station, along with the suspect Counterfeit Notes, at the end of the month.

5.2 For cases of detection of Counterfeit Notes of five (05) or more pieces in a single transaction, the Counterfeit Notes shall be forwarded immediately by the Nodal Bank Officer to the local police authorities or the Nodal Police Station for investigation by filing FIR in the prescribed format (Annex IV). 5.3 A copy of the monthly consolidated report / FIR shall be sent to the Forged Note Vigilance (FNV) Cell constituted at the Head Office of the bank.

5.4 Acknowledgement of the police authorities concerned has to be obtained for note/s forwarded to them (both for consolidated monthly statement and for filing of FIR). If the Counterfeit Notes are sent to the police by insured post, acknowledgement of receipt thereof by the police shall be invariably obtained and kept on record. A proper follow- up of receipt of acknowledgement from the police authorities is necessary. In case any difficulty is faced by the banks due to reluctance of the police to receive monthly consolidated statement / file FIRs, the matter may be sorted out in consultation with the Nodal Officer of the police authority designated to coordinate on matters relating to investigation of Counterfeit Note cases. The list of Nodal Police Stations may be obtained from the concerned Issue Office of RBI. 5.5 In order to facilitate identification of people abetting circulation of Counterfeit Notes, banks are advised to cover the banking hall / area and counters under CCTV surveillance and preserve the recording as per their internal policy.
