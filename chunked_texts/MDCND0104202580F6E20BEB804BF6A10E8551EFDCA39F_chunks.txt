Each such impounded note shall be recorded under authentication, in a separate register. 4.

In case any difficulty is faced by the banks due to reluctance of the police to receive monthly consolidated statement / file FIRs, the matter may be sorted out in consultation with the Nodal Officer of the police authority designated to coordinate on matters relating to investigation of Counterfeit Note cases.

5.5 In order to facilitate identification of people abetting circulation of Counterfeit Notes, banks are advised to cover the banking hall / area and counters under CCTV surveillance and preserve the recording as per their internal policy. 5.6 Banks shall also monitor the patterns / trends of such detection and suspicious trends / patterns and bring to the notice of RBI / police authorities immediately. 5.7 The progress made by banks in detection and reporting of Counterfeit Notes to police, RBI, etc. and problems therein, shall be discussed regularly in the meetings of various State Level Committees viz., State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Standing Committee on Currency Management (SCCM), State Level Security Committee (SLSC), etc. 5.8 The data on detection of Counterfeit Notes by banks shall be included in the monthly returns forwarded to the concerned Issue Office of RBI as indicated in para 10 below.
