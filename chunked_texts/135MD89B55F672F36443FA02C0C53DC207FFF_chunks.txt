Procedure for compounding 5.1 On receipt of an application, the Reserve Bank shall examine the application based on the documents and submissions made in the application and assess whether contravention can be compounded in accordance with the Compounding Rules, 2024 7 and, if so, the sum involved in the contravention. 5.2 The Compounding Authority may call for any information, or any other documents relevant to the compounding proceedings. In case the contravener fails to submit the additional information/documents called for within the specified period, the application for compounding shall be liable to be returned.

5.3 The following factors, which are only indicative, shall be taken into consideration for the purpose of passing compounding order and determining amount on payment of which contravention shall be compounded: a) Undue gains i.e., the amount of gain of unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the contravention (or) economic benefits accruing to the contravener from delayed compliance or compliance avoided; b) the amount of loss caused to any authority/ exchequer as a result of the contravention; c) the repetitive nature of the contravention, the track record and/or history of non- compliance of the contravener; d) contravener’s conduct in undertaking the transaction and in disclosure of full facts in the application and submissions made during the personal hearing; and any other factor as considered relevant and appropriate.

5.4 As per provisions under section 13 of FEMA,1999, the penalty amount can be up to three times the sum involved in the contravention. However, the compounding amount payable, as per Section 15 of FEMA, 1999, is calculated based on guidance note given below. It may, further, be noted that the guidance note is meant only for the purpose of broadly indicating the basis on which the compounding amount is derived by the compounding authorities in the Reserve Bank.

The manner in which the demand draft has to be drawn and deposited/ details of bank account for transferring through electronic mode of payment shall be indicated in the compounding order.
