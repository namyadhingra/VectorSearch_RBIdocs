(b) These Directions shall come into effect from April 1, 2025. 2. Applicability These Directions shall apply to all Regional Rural Banks (RRBs). 3. Purpose This Master Direction covers instructions regarding the capital required to be provided for by banks commensurate with their risks and the components thereof. These Directions serve to specify the prudential norms from the point of view of capital adequacy. Permission for RRBs to undertake transactions in specific instruments/products/ activities shall be guided by the regulations, instructions and guidelines on the same issued by Reserve Bank from time to time. 4.

Chapter II: Composition of Regulatory Capital 5. Minimum regulatory capital RRBs are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent on an ongoing basis. A bank shall compute CRAR in the following manner: Total Capital Eligible Capital Funds = (CRAR) Total Risk Weighted Assets Where, Total Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) is calculated as the aggregate of RWAs and other off-balance sheet exposures, as mentioned in paragraph 7 below.

6. Definition of Capital Funds The Capital Funds for capital adequacy purpose shall consist of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 6.1 Tier 1 Capital 6.1.1 Components of Tier 1 Capital The elements of Tier 1 Capital are: 4 (a) Paid up share capital (b) Share premium, if any, resulting from the issue of shares (c) Share capital deposit (d) Statutory and other free reserves1 (e) Capital Reserve representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets (f) Revaluation reserves, arising out of change in the carrying amount of a bank’s property consequent upon its revaluation, may be reckoned as Tier 1 capital at a discount of 55 per cent, subject to meeting the following conditions:

(i) the bank is able to sell the property readily at its own will and there is no legal impediment in selling the property; (ii) the revaluation reserves are shown under Schedule 2: Reserves & Surplus in the Balance Sheet of the bank; (iii) revaluations are realistic, in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards; (iv) valuations are obtained, from two independent valuers, at least once in every three years;

(v) where the value of the property has been substantially impaired by any event, these are to be immediately revalued and appropriately factored into capital adequacy computations; (vi) the external auditors of the bank have not expressed a qualified opinion on the revaluation of the property; (vii) the instructions on valuation of properties and other specific requirements as mentioned in the circular RPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.115/03.05.33/2008-09 dated June 22, 2009 on ‘Valuation of Properties - Empanelment of Valuers’ are strictly adhered to. Note: Revaluation reserves which do not qualify as Tier 1 capital shall also not qualify as Tier 2 capital. The bank may choose to reckon revaluation reserves in Tier 1 capital or Tier 2 capital at its discretion, subject to fulfilment of all the conditions specified above. 1 In terms of extant guidelines (refer paragraph 22 of Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021), RRBs shall make provisions for DTL on the Special Reserve created under section 36(1) (viii) of Income Tax Act, 1961. Such reserves are part of Free Reserves and may be included in Tier 1 Capital. 5

(g) Balance in Profit & Loss Account at the end of the previous financial year. (h) Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs), which comply with the regulatory requirements as specified in Annex I are eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 capital, subject to the limits prescribed in paragraph 6.1.2 below. 6.1.2 Limits in Tier 1 Capital (a) The total Tier 1 capital shall not be less than 7 per cent of RWAs after the regulatory adjustment / deduction as per paragraph 6.1.3 below. (b) Of the minimum Tier 1 capital of 7 percent, the PDIs will be limited to 1.5 per cent of the total RWAs. (c) Any additional amount raised through PDIs over and above the 1.5 per cent of the RWAs may also be reckoned as Tier 1 capital. Provided that the bank complies with the minimum Tier 1 capital of 7 percent of RWAs before reckoning such additional amounts. 6.1.3 Regulatory Adjustments/ Deductions from Capital 6.1.3.1 The following items shall be fully deducted from Tier 1 capital:

(a) Goodwill and other intangible assets (b) Losses in current year and those brought forward from previous years (c) Defined Benefit Pension Fund Assets and Liabilities: Defined benefit pension fund liabilities, as included on the balance sheet, must be fully recognised in the calculation of Tier 1 capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital cannot be increased through derecognising these liabilities). For each defined benefit pension fund that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the calculation of Tier 1. Note 1: The following items, if identified in the course of supervisory inspection, or otherwise, will also be deducted from Tier 1 capital:

(i) Deficit in NPA provisions2 (ii) Income wrongly recognized on non-performing assets (iii) Provision required for liability devolved on bank, and such similar amounts. 2 Refers to shortfall, if any, in NPA provisions made by the bank in comparison to the regulatory requirements as per the extant norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances. 6 Note 2: In terms of Reserve Bank of India (Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021, dated August 30, 2021, as amended from time to time, pension related unamortised expenditure would not be reduced from Tier 1 Capital of the RRBs. 6.1.3.2 Treatment of Deferred Tax Assets (a) Deferred tax assets (DTAs) associated with accumulated losses and other such assets shall be deducted in full from Tier 1 capital.

(b) DTAs which relate to timing differences (other than those related to accumulated losses) may, instead of full deduction from Tier 1 capital, be recognized in the Tier 1 capital up to 10% of a bank's Tier 1 capital (after the application of all regulatory adjustments). (c) The amount of DTAs which are to be deducted from Tier 1 capital may be netted with associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs), Provided that: • Both the DTAs and DTLs relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and offsetting is permitted by the relevant taxation authority; • The DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that have been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension assets; and • The DTLs must be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital as at (a) and (b) above. 6.2 Tier 2 Capital 6.2.1 Components of Tier 2 Capital

(a) General Provisions and Loss Reserves General provisions and loss reserves will be admitted as Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 1.25 per cent of the total RWAs. Provided that, banks have taken adequate care to ensure that sufficient provisions have been made to meet all known losses and foreseeable potential losses before considering any amount of general provision as part of Tier 2 capital. 7 (b) Investment Fluctuation Reserve Banks may include the entire amount of balance in Investment Fluctuation Reserve in Tier 2 capital. Note: The cap applicable on recognition of General Provisions and Loss Reserves as Tier 2 capital is not applicable to IFR. 6.2.2 Limits on Tier 2 Capital The total of Tier 2 elements will be limited to a maximum of 100 percent of total Tier 1 elements for the purpose of compliance with the capital adequacy framework. Chapter III: Computation of Risk Weighted Assets

7. Risk Adjusted Assets and Off-Balance Sheet Items Risk adjusted assets means the weighted aggregate of funded and non-funded items. Degrees of credit risk expressed as percentage weightings have been assigned to Balance Sheet assets and conversion factors to off-Balance Sheet items. Banks shall multiply the value of each asset/item by the relevant weights to produce risk-adjusted values of assets and of off-Balance Sheet items. The aggregate shall constitute the total RWAs to be taken into account for computing CRAR. The weights allotted to each category of Balance Sheet assets and off-Balance Sheet items are furnished in the Annex II. Chapter IV: Reporting

8. Reporting Banks shall furnish an annual return to the respective NABARD Regional Office, indicating capital funds and risk assets ratio, in the format given in Annex III. The return shall be signed by two officials who are authorised to sign the statutory returns submitted to the Reserve Bank. The statement shall be furnished as soon as the annual accounts are finalised. Chapter V: Repeal and other provisions

9. Repeal Provisions With the issue of these Directions, the instructions / guidelines contained in the circulars mentioned in the Annex IV stand repealed. All the instructions / guidelines given in the above circulars shall be deemed as given under these Directions. Any 8 reference in other Circulars / Guidelines / Notifications issued by the Reserve Bank containing reference to the said repealed Circulars, shall mean the reference to these Directions, namely, the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy for Regional Rural Banks) Directions, 2025, after the date of repeal. Notwithstanding such repeal, any action taken, purported to have been taken or initiated under the Circulars hereby repealed shall continue to be governed by the provisions of the said Circulars.

10. Application of other laws not barred The provisions of these Directions shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the provisions of any other laws, rules, regulations or directions, for the time being in force.

11. Interpretations For the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of these Directions or in order to remove any difficulties in the application or interpretation of the provisions of these Directions, the Reserve Bank of India may, if it considers necessary, issue necessary clarifications in respect of any matter covered herein and the interpretation of any provision of these Directions given by the Reserve Bank of India shall be final and binding. 9 Annex I [Paragraph 6.1.1(h)] Terms and Conditions applicable to Perpetual Debt Instruments to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 Capital The Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs) that may be issued as bonds or debentures by RRBs should meet the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion as Tier 1 Capital for capital adequacy purposes: 1. Terms of Issue of PDIs (a) Amount: RRBs shall issue PDI in Indian currency only. The amount of PDI to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.

(b) Paid-in Status: The instruments should be issued by the bank (i.e., not by any ‘SPV’ etc. set up by the bank for this purpose) and fully paid-in. (c) Limits: Within minimum Tier 1 of 7 percent, the PDIs will be limited to 1.5 per cent of the total RWAs. Any additional amount raised through PDIs over and above the 1.5 per cent of the RWAs will also be reckoned as Tier 1 capital provided the bank complies with the minimum Tier 1 capital of 7 percent of RWAs before reckoning such additional amounts. (d) Maturity Period: The instruments shall be Perpetual i.e., there is no maturity date and there are no step- ups or other incentives to redeem. (e) Rate of Interest:

(i) The interest payable to the investors shall be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate. (ii) The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive coupon feature, i.e., a coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banks’ credit standing. For this purpose, any reference rate including a broad index which is sensitive to changes to the bank’s own creditworthiness and / or to changes in the credit 10 Annex I worthiness of the wider banking sector will be treated as a credit sensitive reference rate. (f) Options: PDI shall not be issued with a 'put option' or a 'step-up option'. However, RRBs may issue the instruments with a call option subject to strict compliance with each of the following conditions:

(i) Call option shall be exercised only after the instrument has run for minimum five years; and (ii) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of RBI (Department of Regulation). While considering the proposals received from RRBs for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank’s CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option. (g) Lock-In Clause: (i) PDI should be subject to a lock-in clause in terms of which the issuing bank shall not be liable to pay interest, if (a) The bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI. Or

(b) The impact of such payment results in bank's capital to risk assets ratio (CRAR) falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI. (ii) However, RRBs may pay interest with the prior approval of RBI, when the impact of such payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR remains above the regulatory norm. For this purpose, ‘Net Loss’ would mean either (a) the accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year; or (b) the loss incurred during the current financial year. (iii) The interest shall not be cumulative. 11 Annex I (iv) All instances of invocation of the lock-in clause should be notified by the issuing banks to the Chief General Manager, Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India and Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai. (h) Seniority of Claim: The claims of the investors in PDI shall be:

(i) Senior to the claims of investors in equity shares; and (ii) Subordinated to the claims of all other creditors. (i) Discount: The PDIs shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes since these are perpetual. (j) Other Conditions: (i) PDI should be fully paid-up, unsecured, and free of any restrictive clauses. (ii) RRBs should comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by SEBI / other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the instruments. 2. Compliance with Reserve Requirements The total amount raised by a bank through PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements.

3. Reporting Requirements RRBs issuing PDI shall submit a report to Chief General Manager, Department of Supervision, NABARD, Head Office, Mumbai giving details of the debt raised, including the terms of issue specified at paragraph 1 above, together with a copy of the offer document, soon after the issue is completed. 4. Investment in PDIs (a) RRBs shall not invest in PDI issued by other banks including RRBs. (b) RRBs shall not issue PDI to retail investors/ FPI/ NRIs. 12 Annex I 5. Grant of Advances against PDI RRBs should not grant advances against the security of the PDI issued by them.

Bills negotiated under LCs under reserve, bills purchased / discounted / negotiated without LCs, will be reckoned as exposure on the borrower constituent. Accordingly, the exposure will attract a risk weight appropriate to the borrower. 8

B. Off-Balance Sheet Items The credit risk exposure attached to Off-Balance Sheet items has to be first calculated by multiplying the face value of each of the Off-Balance Sheet items by ‘credit conversion factor’ as indicated in the table below. This will then have to be again multiplied by the weights attributable to the relevant counter-party as specified above. Credit Sl. No. Instruments Conversion Factor (%) Direct credit substitutes e.g., general guarantees of indebtedness (including 1 standby L/Cs serving as financial guarantees for loans and securities) and 100 acceptances (including endorsements with the character of acceptance) Certain transaction-related contingent items (e.g., performance bonds, bid 2 50 bonds, warranties and standby L/Cs related to particular transactions) 17 Annex II Credit Sl. No. Instruments Conversion Factor (%) Short-term self-liquidating trade-related contingencies (such as 3 20 documentary credits collateralized by the underlying shipments) Sale and repurchase agreement and asset sales with recourse, where the 4 100 credit risk remains with the bank Forward asset purchase, forward deposit and partly paid shares and 5 100 securities, which represent commitments with certain draw down 6 Note issuance facilities and revolving underwriting facilities 50 Other commitments (e.g., formal standby facilities and credit lines) with an 7 50 original maturity of over one year Similar commitments with an original maturity up to one year, or which can be unconditionally cancelled at any time. Note: In respect of borrowers having aggregate fund based working capital 8 limit of ₹150 crore and above from the banking system, the undrawn portion 0 of cash credit / overdraft limits sanctioned, irrespective of whether unconditionally cancellable or not, shall attract a credit conversion factor of 20 percent. Guarantees issued by banks against the counter guarantees of other

(i) 20 banks Rediscounting of documentary bills accepted by banks. Bills 9 (ii) discounted by banks which have been accepted by another bank will 20 be treated as a funded claim on a bank. Note: In these cases, banks should be fully satisfied that the risk exposure is, in fact, on the other bank. Aggregate outstanding foreign exchange contracts of original maturity* – (a) Less than 14 calendar days 0

(b) More than 14 calendar days but less than one year 2 10 (c) For each additional year or part thereof 3 * In case the bank has adopted the Bilateral Netting guidelines as per Part II below, Credit Conversion Factor (CCF) for foreign exchange contracts shall be as provided in the second table in Part II below and CCF of “zero” per cent for foreign exchange contracts which have original maturity of 14 calendar days or less will not be applicable. Note: At present, RRB may not be undertaking most of the off-balance sheet transactions. However, keeping in view their potential for expansion, risk-weights are indicated against various off balance sheet items, which, perhaps banks may undertake in future. II. Additional Risk Weights (Applicable to Authorised Dealers Only) 18 Annex II 1. Foreign Exchange Contracts (a) Foreign exchange contracts include the following: (i) Cross currency swaps (ii) Forward foreign exchange contracts (iii) Currency futures (iv) Currency options purchased

(i) Step 1 - The notional principal amount of each instrument is multiplied by the conversion factor given below: Original maturity Conversion Factor Less than one year 2% One year and less than two years 5% (i.e., 2% + 3%) For each additional year 3% When effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in paragraph II.3 of this Annex are in place, the conversion factors, as mentioned in the below table, shall be applicable*: Original maturity Conversion Factor Less than one year 1.5% One year and less than two years 3.75% (i.e., 1.5% + 2.25%) For each additional year 2.25% (ii) Step 2 - The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weightage allotted to the relevant counter-party as given in paragraph I.A above. *Note: For purposes of calculating the credit exposure to a netting counterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, the original credit conversion factors (i.e., without considering the impact of bilateral netting) should be applied to the notional principal, which is defined as the 19 Annex II net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. In no case should the reduced factors above be applied to net notional amounts.

2. Interest Rate Contracts (a) Interest rate contracts include the following: (i) Single currency interest rate swaps (ii) Basis swaps (iii) Forward rate agreements (iv) Interest rate futures (v) Interest rate options purchased (vi) Other contracts of a similar nature (b) As in the case of other off-balance Sheet items, a two-stage calculation prescribed below shall be applied:

(i) Step 1 - The notional principal amount of each instrument is multiplied by the percentages given below: Original maturity Conversion Factor Less than one year 0.5% One year and less than two years 1% For each additional year 1% When effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in paragraph II.3 of this Annex are in place, the conversion factors, as mentioned in the below table, shall be applicable: Original maturity Conversion Factor Less than one year 0.35% One year and less than two years 0.75% For each additional year 0.75% (ii) Step 2 - The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weightage allotted to the relevant counter-party as given in paragraph I.A above. Note: In the event of any uncertainty in assigning risk weights against a specific transaction, RBI clarification may be sought for. 20 Annex II 3. Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract:

(a) Banks may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between a bank and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations. (b) Banks may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting not covered in (a), including other forms of novation. (c) In both cases (a) and (b), a bank will need to satisfy that it has:

(i) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that the bank would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances. (ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under: • The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located; • The law that governs the individual transactions; and • The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting. (iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.

(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose of calculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A walkaway clause is a provision which permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make only 21 Annex II limited payments or no payment at all, to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor. 22 Appendix to Annex II Conditions to be satisfied in respect of exposures guaranteed under any existing or future schemes launched by CGTMSE, CRGFTLIH and NCGTC for applicability of the risk weight of zero percent i. Prudential Aspects: The guarantees provided under the respective schemes shall comply with the requirements for credit risk mitigation in terms of paragraph 7.5 of the Master Circular– Basel III Capital Regulations dated April 01, 2024, as amended from time to time. Among other requirements, such guarantees should be direct, explicit, irrevocable and unconditional. ii. Restrictions on permissible claims: Where the terms of the guarantee schemes restrict the maximum permissible claims through features like specified extent of guarantee coverage, clause on first loss absorption by Member Lending Institutions (MLI), payout cap, etc., the zero percent risk weight shall be restricted to the maximum permissible claim and the residual exposure shall be subjected to risk weight as applicable to the counterparty in terms of extant regulations. iii.
