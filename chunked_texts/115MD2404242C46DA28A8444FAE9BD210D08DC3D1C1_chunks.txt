Acquisition of financial assets

9.1 Every ARC shall frame a Board-approved 'financial asset acquisition policy' within ninety days of grant of the CoR which shall provide that transactions take place in a transparent manner and at a fair price in a well-informed market and the transactions are executed on arm’s length basis by exercise of due diligence. It shall clearly lay down the policies and guidelines covering, inter alia, the following: (i) norms and procedure for acquisition either on its own books or directly in the books of the trust; (ii) types and the desirable profile of the assets; (iii) valuation procedure ensuring that the assets acquired have realisable value which is capable of being reasonably estimated and independently valued; and (iv) in the case of financial assets acquired for asset reconstruction, the broad parameters for formulation of plans for their realisation. 9.2 The Board may delegate powers to a committee comprising any director and/ or any functionaries of the ARC for taking decisions on proposals for acquisition of financial assets. 9.3 Deviation from the policy should be made only with the approval of the Board.

9.4 Before bidding for the stressed assets, ARCs may seek adequate time, of not less than two weeks, from the auctioning banks to conduct a meaningful due diligence of the account by verifying the underlying assets. 9.5 The share of financial assets to be acquired from the bank/ financial institution should be appropriately and objectively worked out keeping in view the provision in the Act requiring consent of secured creditors holding not less than 60% of the amount outstanding to a borrower for the purpose of enforcement of security interest. 12 9.6 For easy and faster realisability, all the financial assets due from a single debtor to various banks/ financial institutions may be considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets having linkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure relatively faster and easy realisation. 9.7 Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of assets for acquisition. Assets classified as special mentioned accounts (SMAs) in the books of the originator may also be acquired.

9.8 Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding commitments, if any, of any bank/ financial institution to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security interest in non-fund transactions, should provide for the relative commitments to continue with bank/ financial institution, till demand for funding arises. 9.9 As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile. It should be ensured that the valuation of the financial assets is done in a scientific and objective manner. Valuation may be done either internally or by engaging an independent agency, depending upon the value of the assets. Ideally, valuation may be entrusted to the committee authorised to approve acquisition of assets, which may carry out the task in line with financial asset acquisition policy mentioned at paragraph 9.1. 9.10 An ARC can sell financial asset to another ARC subject to the following conditions:

(i) The transaction is settled on cash basis; (ii) Price discovery for such transaction shall not be prejudicial to the interest of SR holders; (iii) The selling ARC shall utilize the proceeds so received for the redemption of underlying security receipts (SRs); and (iv) The date of redemption of underlying SRs and total period of realisation shall not extend beyond eight years from the date of acquisition of the financial asset by the first ARC. 9.11 ARCs shall not acquire financial assets from the following on a bilateral basis, whatever may be the consideration: 13 (i) a bank/ financial institution which is the sponsor of the ARC; (ii) a bank/ financial institution which is either a lender to the ARC or a subscriber to the fund, if any, raised by the ARC for its operations; (iii) an entity in the group to which the ARC belongs. However, they may participate in the auctions of the financial assets provided such auctions are conducted in a transparent manner, on arm’s length basis and the prices are determined by the market forces. 10. Plan for realisation of financial assets

10.1 Every ARC may, within the planning period, formulate a plan for realisation of assets which may provide for one or more of the following measures: (i) Change in or takeover of the management of the business of the borrower (ii) Sale or lease of the whole or part of business of borrower (iii) Rescheduling of debts payable by the borrower (iv) Enforcement of security interest in accordance with the provisions of the Act (v) Settlement of dues payable by the borrower (vi) Conversion of any portion of debt into equity of a borrower company 10.2 The ARC shall formulate the policy for realisation of financial assets under which the period for realisation shall not exceed five years from the date of acquisition of the financial asset concerned. 10.3 The Board of the ARC may increase the period for realisation of financial assets so that the total period for realisation shall not exceed eight years from the date of acquisition of the financial asset concerned.

10.4 In case, the ARC is one of the lenders in an account, where a resolution plan has been finalised and the same extends beyond the maximum resolution period allowed for ARCs as per paragraph 10.3 above, the ARC may accept a resolution period co-terminus with other secured lenders. 14 10.5 The Board of the ARC shall specify the steps that shall be taken by the ARC to realise the financial assets within the time frame referred to in the paragraphs 10.2 and 10.3 above as the case may be. 10.6 The qualified buyers (QBs) shall be entitled to invoke the provisions of Section 7(3) of the Act only at the end of such extended period if the period for realisation is extended under paragraph 10.3 above.

(b) The change in or takeover of the management of the business of the borrower should be done only after the proposal is examined by an Independent Advisory Committee (IAC) to be appointed by the ARC consisting of professionals having technical/ finance/ legal background who, after assessment of the financial position of the borrower, time frame available for recovery of the debt from the borrower, future prospects of the business of the borrower and other relevant aspects, shall recommend to the ARC that it may resort to change in or takeover of the management of the business of the borrower and that such action would be necessary for effective running of the business leading to recovery of its dues. (c) The Board of Directors including at least two independent directors of the ARC should deliberate on the recommendations of the IAC and consider the various options available for the recovery of dues before deciding whether under the existing circumstances, the change in or takeover of the management of the business of the borrower is necessary and the decision shall be specifically included in the minutes.

Conversion of any portion of debt into equity of a borrower entity 16.1 The ARC shall frame a Board-approved policy, laying down the broad parameters for conversion of debt into equity of the borrower entity.

16.2 In cases of financial assets, which have turnaround potential after restructuring but normally with huge default and unsustainable level of debt, it shall be necessary to arrive at sustainable level of debt, on the basis of evaluation of detailed business plan with projected level of operations, which can be serviced by the entity. A part of residual unsustainable debt may have to be converted into equity for an optimal debt equity structure. While ARCs are permitted to have significant influence or have a say in the decisions surrounding the borrower entity’s turnaround through conversion of debt into equity, they should not be seen to be running the entities. The shareholding of the ARC shall not exceed 26% of the post converted equity of the entity under reconstruction. 23

16.3 However, ARCs satisfying the conditions mentioned below are exempted from the limit of shareholding at 26% of post converted equity of the borrower entity subject to compliance with the provisions of the Act, guidelines/ instructions issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time as applicable to ARCs as well as Foreign Exchange Management Act,1999, Reserve Bank of India Act,1934, Companies Act, 2013, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Regulations and other relevant statutes.

The frequency of valuation shall be at least once in a month.

16.4 The ARC shall explore the possibility of preparing a panel of sector-specific management entities/ individuals having expertise in running entities which could be considered for managing the entities. 17. Securitisation 17.1 Special features of Security Receipts (SRs) (i) SRs cannot be strictly characterized as debt instruments since they combine the features of both equity and debt. However, these are recognized as securities under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. (ii) The cash flows from the underlying assets cannot be predicted in terms of value and intervals. (iii) These instruments, when rated, would generally be below investment grade. These instruments are privately placed. 24 17.2 Issuance of SRs

(i) An ARC shall give effect to the provisions of Sections 7(1) and 7(2) of the Act through one or more trusts set up exclusively for the purpose. The trusteeship of such trusts shall vest with the ARC. (ii) The ARC proposing to issue SRs shall, prior to such an issue, formulate a Board- approved policy providing for issue of SRs under each scheme formulated by the trust. (iii) The ARC shall transfer the assets to the said trusts at the price at which those assets were acquired from the originator if the assets are not acquired directly on the books of the trust. (iv) The trusts shall issue SRs only to QBs and such SRs shall be transferable/ assignable only in favour of other QBs. (v) The trusts shall hold and administer the financial assets for the benefit of the QBs. 17.3 Investment in SRs issued by the trusts floated by the ARC: ARCs shall, by transferring funds, invest in the SRs at a minimum of either 15% of the transferors’ investment in the SRs or 2.5% of the total SRs issued, whichever is higher, of each class of SRs issued by them under each scheme on an ongoing basis till the redemption of all the SRs issued under such scheme. 17.4 Rating/ Grading of SRs

(i) Every ARC shall mandatorily obtain initial rating/ grading of SRs from a SEBI registered CRA within a period of six months from the date of acquisition of assets and declare the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the SRs issued by it. Thereafter, ARCs shall get the rating/ grading of SRs reviewed from the CRA as on June 30, and December 31 every year and declare the NAV of SRs forthwith, to enable the QBs to value their investments in SRs. (ii) The rating shall be assigned on a specifically developed rating scale called ‘recovery rating (RR) scale’. Each rating category in the recovery scale shall have an associate range of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which can be used for arriving at 25 the NAV of SRs. Symbols should be assigned by the CRAs to the associated range of recovery, which would inter se not deviate by a specified percentage points, say (+/ -) 10%. The rating would be indicative. The rating/ grading should be based on ‘recovery risk’ as against ‘default’ which is the basis for rating assignments in normal assets, i.e., how much more can be recovered instead of timely payment. Rating should reflect present value of the anticipated recoverability of the future cash flows. (iii) The recovery rating shall be assessed after factoring in any other relevant obligation and not on the original debt obligation. The other key factors that should be factored in while assigning recovery rating are extent of debt acquired, composition of lenders, collaterals available, security and seniority of debt, individual lender vis-à-vis institutional lender, estimated cash flows, uncertainty in realising expected cash flows in initial period, management, business risk, financial risk, etc. The recovery rating shall also reflect changes like change in resolution strategy of the ARC from time to time. (iv) The recovery rating should comprise of rating of not only the SRs of the scheme as a whole but wherever feasible a desegregation of each component in the scheme, which means that the underlying assets of each entity in the scheme forming the basket should also be rated.

(v) ARCs shall require the CRAs to disclose the assumptions and rationale behind the rating and shall disclose these to SR holders. (vi) ARCs shall retain a CRA for at least six rating cycles (of half year each). If a CRA is changed mid-way through these six rating cycles, the ARC shall disclose the reason for such change.

17.5 Methodology for valuation of SRs for declaration of NAV: Each rating category in the recovery scale shall have an associate range of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which can be used for computing the NAV of SRs. The NAV should be restricted within the recovery range associated with the rating assigned to the SRs. The ARC based on its recovery experience should choose a particular percentage within the recovery range indicated by the CRA. The recovery rating percentage so picked by the ARC 26 multiplied by the face value of the SR shall give the NAV. The ARC should provide the rationale for selection of the particular percentage of recovery rating. Illustration: If the range of recovery is between 81% - 90%, ARC may pick up 87% based on its judgement. If the face value of SR is ₹10, the face value will be multiplied by the recovery percentage, i.e., 87%, to arrive at the NAV as ₹8.70. 17.6 Restructuring support finance: An ARC can utilize a part of funds raised under a scheme from the QBs for restructuring of financial assets acquired under the relative scheme subject to the following conditions:

(i) ARCs with acquired assets in excess of ₹500 crore can float the fund under a scheme which envisages the utilization of part of funds raised from QBs in terms of Section 7(2) of the Act, for restructuring of financial assets acquired out of such funds. (ii) The extent of funds that shall be utilized for reconstruction purpose should not be more than 25% of the funds raised under the scheme in terms of Section 7(2) of the Act. The funds raised to be utilized for reconstruction (within the ceiling of 25%) should be disclosed upfront in the scheme. Further, the funds utilized for reconstruction purposes should be separately accounted for. (iii) Every ARC shall frame a Board-approved policy laying down the broad parameters for utilization of funds raised from QBs under such a scheme. 17.7 Disclosures: Every ARC intending to issue SRs shall make disclosures mentioned in Annex I. 27 Section IV: Prudential regulations

18. Capital adequacy ratio: Every ARC shall maintain, on an ongoing basis, a capital adequacy ratio of minimum 15% of its total risk weighted assets. Capital for the purpose of calculation of capital adequacy ratio will have the same meaning as NOF. The risk- weighted assets shall be calculated as the weighted aggregate of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items as detailed hereunder: On-balance sheet items Risk weight (%) (i) Cash and deposits with scheduled commercial 0 banks/ SIDBI/ NABARD (ii) Investments in Government securities 0 (iii) Shares in other ARCs 0 (iv) All other assets (including ROU asset) 100 Off-balance sheet items (v) All contingent liabilities 50 Note: Assets which have been deducted from owned fund to arrive at NOF shall have risk weight of 0%. 19. Asset classification 19.1 Every ARC shall, after taking into account the degree of well-defined credit weaknesses and extent of dependence on collateral security for realisation, classify the assets held in its own books into following categories, namely: (i) Standard assets; and (ii) NPAs 19.2 The NPAs shall be classified further as-

(i) 'Sub-standard asset' for a period not exceeding 12 months from the date it was classified as NPA; (ii) 'Doubtful asset' if the asset remains a sub-standard asset for a period exceeding 12 months; (iii) 'Loss asset' if- a) the asset is non-performing for a period exceeding 36 months; 28 b) the asset is adversely affected by a potential threat of non-recoverability due to either erosion in the value of security or non-availability of security; c) the asset has been identified as a loss asset by the ARC or its internal or external auditor; or d) the financial asset including SRs is not realized within the total time frame specified in the plan for realisation formulated by the ARC under paragraph 10.2 or 10.3 and the ARC or the trust concerned continues to hold those assets. 19.3 Assets acquired by the ARC for the purpose of asset reconstruction may be treated as standard assets during the planning period, if any.

19.4 Where the terms of agreement regarding interest and/ or principal relating to a standard asset have been renegotiated or rescheduled by an ARC (otherwise than during planning period), the asset concerned shall be classified as sub-standard asset with effect from the date of renegotiation/ rescheduling or continue to remain as a sub-standard or doubtful asset as the case be. The asset may be upgraded as a standard asset only after satisfactory performance for a period of 12 months as per the renegotiated/ rescheduled terms. 20. Provisioning requirements: Every ARC shall make provisions against NPAs, as under: Asset category Provisioning required Sub-standard assets A general provision of 10% of the outstanding amount Doubtful assets (i) 100% provision to the extent the asset is not covered by the estimated realisable value of security (ii) In addition to item (i) above, 50% of the remaining outstanding amount Loss assets The entire asset shall be written off (If, for any reason, the asset is retained in the books, 100% thereof shall be provided for). 29 Section V: Governance and conduct 21.

24.3 Where any of the accounting policies is not in conformity with these guidelines/ instructions, the particulars of departures shall be disclosed together with the reasons therefor and the financial impact on account thereof. Where such an effect is not ascertainable, the fact shall be so disclosed citing the reasons therefor. 24.4 An inappropriate treatment of an item in balance sheet or profit and loss account cannot be deemed to have been rectified either by disclosure of accounting policies used or by disclosure in notes to balance sheet and profit and loss account. 24.5 ARCs covered by Rule 4 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 are required to comply with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) for the preparation of their financial statements. In order to promote a high quality and consistent implementation as well as facilitate comparison and better supervision, Reserve Bank has issued regulatory guidance on Ind AS vide circular DOR (NBFC).CC.PD.No.109/

22.10.106/2019-20 dated March 13, 2020 which, along with subsequent instructions on the subject, is applicable on such ARCs for preparation of their financial statements from financial year 2019-20 onwards. 25. Investments 25.1 Considering the nature of investment in SRs where underlying cash flows are dependent on realisation from NPAs, it can be classified as available for sale. Hence, 39 investments in SRs may be aggregated for the purpose of arriving at net depreciation/ appreciation of investments under the category. Net depreciation, if any, shall be provided for. Net appreciation, if any, should be ignored. 25.2 All other investments should be valued at lower of cost or realisable value. Where market rates are available, the market value would be presumed to be the realisable value and in cases, where market rates are not available, the realisable value should be the fair value. However, investments in other ARCs shall be treated as long term investments and valued in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. 26. Income recognition 26.1 Yield on SRs should be recognised only after the full redemption of the entire principal amount of SRs.

26.2 Upside income should be recognized only after full redemption of SRs. 26.3 Management fees should be calculated and charged as a percentage of the NAV calculated at the lower end of the range of the recovery rating specified by the CRA, provided that the same is not more than the acquisition value of the underlying asset. However, management fees are to be reckoned as a percentage of the actual outstanding value of SRs, before the availability of NAV of SRs. 26.4 Management fees may be recognized on accrual basis.
