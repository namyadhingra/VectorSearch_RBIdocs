Chapter – III Notes and instructions for compilation

5. The general instructions for the compilation of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account for Commercial Banks are specified in Part A of Annex II. Commercial Banks shall ensure strict compliance with the Accounting Standards notified under the 2 Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2021, as amended from time to time, subject to Directions/Guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India. Co-operative Banks shall be guided by the announcements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) regarding applicability2 of Accounting Standards, subject to Directions/ Guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India. Part B of Annex II specifies guidance with respect to relevant issues in the application of certain Accounting Standards for Commercial Banks. It shall be applicable mutatis mutandis to Co-operative Banks, unless stated otherwise in the said Annex. Chapter – IV Disclosure in financial statements – notes to accounts

6. Banks shall disclose information as specified in Annex III in the notes to accounts of the financial statements. These disclosures are intended only to supplement and not to replace disclosure requirements under other laws, regulations, or accounting and financial reporting standards. More comprehensive disclosures than the minimum required under these Directions are encouraged, especially if such disclosures significantly aid in the understanding of the financial position and performance. Chapter – V Consolidated Financial Statements (not applicable to LABs, RRBs and Co-operative Banks)

7. In addition to standalone financial statements prepared as per the formats prescribed under section 29 of Banking Regulation Act, 1949, Commercial Banks (other than RRBs and LABs), whether listed or unlisted, shall prepare and disclose Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) in their Annual Reports, in the formats prescribed in Annex IV. The CFS shall normally include a consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of profit and loss, principal accounting policies, and notes to accounts. The CFS shall also be submitted to the Department of Supervision (DOS), Reserve Bank of India within one month from the publication of the bank’s annual accounts.

8. CFS shall be prepared in terms of the applicable accounting standards. For the purpose of financial reporting, the terms 'parent', 'subsidiary', ‘associate’, ‘joint venture’, 2 As per prevailing pronouncements of the ICAI, co-operative banks are classified as Level I enterprises. Level I enterprises are required to comply with all the accounting standards. 3 'control', and 'group' shall have the same meaning as ascribed to them in the applicable accounting standards. A parent presenting CFS shall consolidate all subsidiaries - domestic as well as foreign, except those specifically permitted to be excluded under the applicable accounting standards. However, the reasons for not consolidating a subsidiary shall be disclosed in the CFS. The responsibility of determining whether a particular entity shall be included or not for consolidation would be that of the Management of the parent entity. The Statutory Auditors shall mention in their audit report, if they are of the opinion that an entity which ought to have been consolidated has been omitted.

9. In cases where different entities in a group are governed by different accounting norms laid down by the concerned regulator/s, the balance sheet size may be used to determine the dominant activity and accounting norms specified by its regulator may be used for the consolidation of similar transactions and events. Where banking is the dominant activity, accounting norms applicable to a bank shall be used for consolidation purposes in respect of like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. 10. An RRB shall be treated as an associate in the CFS of its sponsor bank. 11. The valuation of investments in subsidiaries that are not consolidated and associates that are not included using the “Equity Method” shall be as per the relevant valuation norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India. 12. The Board of Directors of banks shall invariably record the intent of holding the investment for a temporary period or otherwise at the time of investment in the subsidiary, associate and joint venture. In the absence of a record of such intent by the Board at the time of such investment, the investee entity shall be consolidated into the

CFS. Chapter – VI Other instructions Inter-branch account - provisioning for net debit balance 13. Banks should segregate the credit entries outstanding for more than five years in the inter-branch account and transfer them to a separate ‘Blocked Account’ which should be shown under ‘Other Liabilities and Provisions - Others’ or in the case of Co- operative Banks, under ‘Other Liabilities- Suspense’. Any adjustment from the Blocked 4 Account should be permitted only with the authorisation of two officials, one of whom should be from the Controlling/Head Office if the amount exceeds Rupees One lakh. The balance in Blocked Account shall be reckoned as a liability for the purpose of the maintenance of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR).

14. Banks shall maintain category-wise (head-wise) accounts for various types of transactions put through inter-branch accounts, so that the netting can be done category-wise. As on the balance sheet date, banks shall segregate the debit and credit entries remaining unreconciled for more than six months and arrive at the net position category-wise. The balance in the Blocked Account shall also be considered. Thereafter, the net debit under all the categories of inter-branch accounts shall be aggregated and a provision equivalent to 100 per cent of the aggregate net debit shall be made. While doing so, banks shall ensure that the net debit in one category is not set-off against net credit in another category. Reconciliation of Nostro account and treatment of outstanding entries

15. Banks shall take steps to have a strong control over reconciliation and put in place a system of real-time reconciliation. Escalation of differences, if any, should be done immediately. There should be close monitoring of pending items in Nostro accounts by top management at short intervals. All unreconciled credit entries in Nostro accounts which are outstanding for more than three years shall be transferred to a Blocked Account and shown as outstanding liabilities. The balance in the Blocked Account will be reckoned for the purpose of CRR/SLR. Banks shall make 100 percent provision in respect of all unreconciled debit entries in the Nostro accounts, which are outstanding for more than two years.

16. In the past, Commercial Banks other than RRBs were permitted to transfer to profit and loss account (followed by subsequent appropriation to general reserve) outstanding credit entries of individual value less than USD 2,500 or equivalent in Nostro accounts originated up to March 31, 2002, subject to certain conditions. Banks that availed this benefit shall ensure that any future claims in respect of these entries are honoured. Further the amount appropriated to the general reserve shall not be available for the declaration of dividend. 5 Transfer to/appropriation from Reserve funds 17. In terms of sections 17(1),11(2)(b)(ii) and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 banks are required to transfer, out of the balance of profit as disclosed in the profit and loss account, a sum equivalent to not less than 20 per cent of such profit to Reserve Fund. These provisions are a minimum statutory requirement. However, in order to augment capital, Commercial Banks (excluding LABs and RRBs) shall transfer not less than 25 per cent of the ‘net profit’ before appropriations to the Statutory Reserve.

18. Unless specifically allowed by extant regulations, banks shall take prior approval from the Reserve Bank of India before any appropriation is made from the Statutory Reserve or any other reserve. Banks are further advised that: a) all expenses including provisions and write-offs recognized in a period, whether mandatory or prudential, shall be reflected in the profit and loss account for the period as an ‘above the line’ item (i.e. before arriving at the net profit/loss for the year); b) draw down from reserves, with the prior approval of Reserve Bank of India, shall be effected only ‘below the line’ (i.e. after arriving at the net profit / loss for the year); and c) suitable disclosures shall be made of such draw down in the ‘Notes on Accounts’ to the Balance Sheet.

19. Subject to compliance with applicable laws, banks, without prior approval of Reserve Bank of India, can utilize the share premium account for meeting issue expenses3 of shares to the extent that such expenses are incremental costs directly attributable to the transaction that otherwise would have been avoided. The share premium account shall not be utilized for writing off the expenses relating to the issue of debt instruments.

20. In respect of provisioning for frauds, banks that have reported the fraud within the prescribed time shall have the option to make the provision for the same over a period, not exceeding four quarters, commencing from the quarter in which the fraud has been detected. Where such a bank chooses to provide for the fraud over two to four quarters 3 Registration and other regulatory fees, amounts paid to legal, accounting and other professional advisers, printing costs and stamp duties 6 and this results in the full provisioning being made in more than one financial year, subject to compliance with applicable laws, it may debit reserves other than the Statutory Reserve by the amount remaining un-provided at the end of the financial year by credit to provisions. However, subsequently, it should proportionately reverse the debits to the reserves and complete the provisioning by debiting profit and loss account, in the successive quarters of the next financial year. Where there has been delay, beyond the prescribed period, in reporting the fraud to the Reserve Bank, the entire provisioning is required to be made at once. Unreconciled balances

21. Unreconciled credit balances in any transitory account representing unclaimed balances shall not be transferred to the profit and loss account or to any reserves. Deferred tax liability (DTL) on Special Reserve created under Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 22. Banks shall make provisions for DTL on the Special Reserve created under section 36(1) (viii) of Income Tax Act, 1961. Window dressing 23. Banks shall ensure that balance sheet and profit and loss account reflects true and fair picture of its financial position. Instances of window dressing of financials, short provisioning, misclassification of NPAs, under-reporting/ incorrect computation of exposure/risk weight, incorrect capitalization of expenses, capitalization of interest on NPAs, deliberate inflation of asset and liabilities at the end of the financial year and subsequent reversal immediately in next financial year, etc. shall be viewed seriously and appropriate penal action in terms of the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 shall be considered.

1. Accounting Standard 5 - Net Profit or Loss for the Period, Prior Period Items and Changes in Accounting Policies The objective of this standard is to prescribe the classification and disclosure of certain items in the statement of profit and loss so that all enterprises prepare and present such a statement on a uniform basis. Accordingly, this Standard requires the classification and disclosure of extraordinary and prior period items, and the disclosure of certain items within profit or loss from ordinary activities. It also specifies the accounting treatment for changes in accounting estimates and the disclosures to be made in the financial statements regarding changes in accounting policies. Paragraph 4.3 of Preface to the Statements on Accounting Standards issued by the ICAI states that Accounting Standards are intended to apply only to items which are material. Since materiality is not objectively defined, it has been decided that all banks should ensure compliance with the provisions of the Accounting Standard in respect of any item of prior period income or prior period expenditure which exceeds one per cent of the total income/total expenditure of the bank if the income/expenditure is reckoned on a gross basis or one per cent of the net profit before taxes or net losses as the case may be if the income is reckoned net of costs. Since the format of the profit and loss accounts of banks prescribed in Form B under Third Schedule to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 does not specifically provide for disclosure of the impact of prior period items on the current year’s profit and loss, such disclosures, wherever warranted, may be made in the ‘Notes on Accounts’ to the balance sheet of banks.

2. Accounting Standard 9 – Revenue Recognition Non-recognition of income by the banks in case of non-performing advances and non-performing investments, in compliance with the regulatory prescriptions of the Reserve Bank of India, shall not attract a qualification by the statutory auditors as this would be in conformity with provisions of the standard, as it - 40 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) recognizes postponement of recognition of revenue where collectability of the revenue is significantly uncertain. 3. Accounting Standard 11 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates AS 11 is applied in the context of the accounting for transactions in foreign currencies and in translating the financial statements of foreign operations. The issues that arise in this context have been identified and banks shall be guided by the following while complying with the provisions of the Standard:

(I) Classification of Integral and Non-integral Foreign Operations Paragraph 17 of AS 11 states that the method used to translate the financial statements of a foreign operation depends on the way in which it is financed and operates in relation to the reporting enterprise. For this purpose, foreign operations are classified as either "integral foreign operations" or "non- integral foreign operations". The issue that arises here pertains to the classification of representative offices set up in foreign countries, foreign branches and off-shore banking units set up in India as "integral foreign operation" or "non-integral foreign operation". Taking into consideration the operation of the foreign branches of Indian banks and the indicators listed in paragraph 20 of the standard, it is clarified that foreign branches of Indian banks, IFSC Banking Units (IBUs) and Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) set up in India by banks shall be classified as "non-integral foreign operations". Taking into consideration the operation of the representative offices of banks set up abroad and the explanation in paragraph 18 of the Standard, representative offices shall be classified as "integral foreign operations". These classifications are for the limited purpose of compliance with the Standard. (II) Exchange rate for recording foreign currency transactions and translation of financial statements of non-integral foreign operation. As per paragraphs 9 and 21 of the Standard, a foreign currency transaction shall be recorded by Indian branches and integral foreign operations, on initial recognition in the reporting currency, by applying to the foreign - 41 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) currency amount the exchange rate between the reporting currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Further, paragraph 24(b) of the Standard states that income and expense items of non-integral foreign operations shall be translated at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Indian branches and integral foreign operations of banks may face difficulty in applying the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction in respect of the items which are not being recorded in Indian Rupees or are currently being recorded using a notional exchange rate, due to their extensive branch network and volume of transactions. Banks may also face difficulty in translating income and expense items of a non-integral foreign operation by applying the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Banks, which are in a position to apply the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction for recording the foreign currency transactions at their Indian branches and integral foreign operations and for translating the income and expense items of non-integral foreign operations as required under AS 11 shall comply with the requirements. Banks, which have an extensive branch network, have a high volume of foreign currency transactions and are not fully equipped on the technology front shall be guided by the following: a) Paragraph 10 of the Standard allows, for practical reasons, the use of a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction The Standard also states that if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, the use of average rate for a period is unreliable. Since the enterprises are required to record the transactions at the date of the occurrence thereof, the weekly average closing rate of the preceding week can be used for recording the transactions occurring in the relevant week, if the same approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. In view of the practical difficulties which banks may have in applying the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions and since the Standard allows the use of a rate that approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction, banks may use average rates as detailed below: - 42 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) b) FEDAI publishes a weekly average closing rate at the end of each week and a quarterly average closing rate at the end of each quarter for various currencies. c) In respect of Indian branches and integral foreign operations, those foreign currency transactions, which are currently not being recorded in Indian Rupees at the date of the transaction or are being recorded using a notional exchange rate shall now be recorded at the date of the transaction by using the weekly average closing rate of the preceding week, published by FEDAI, if the same approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. d) Generally, Indian banks prepare the consolidated accounts for their domestic and foreign branches at quarterly or longer intervals. Hence, banks may use the quarterly average closing rate, published by FEDAI at the end of each quarter, for translating the income and expense items of non-integral foreign operations during the quarter. e) If the weekly average closing rate of the preceding week does not approximate the actual rate at the date of the transaction, the closing rate at the date of the transaction shall be used. For this purpose, the weekly average closing rate of the preceding week would not be considered approximating the actual rate at the date of the transaction if the difference between (A) the weekly average closing rate of the preceding week and (B) the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction, is more than three and a half percent of (B). In respect of non-integral foreign operations, if there are significant exchange fluctuations during the quarter, the income and expense items of non-integral foreign operations shall be translated by using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction instead of the quarterly average closing rate. For this purpose, the exchange rate fluctuation would be considered as significant, if the difference between the two rates is more than seven percent of the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. f) Banks are encouraged to equip themselves to record the foreign currency transactions of Indian branches as well as integral foreign operations and - 43 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) translate the income as well as expense items of non-integral foreign operations at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. (III) Closing rate Paragraph 7 of the Standard defines ‘Closing rate’ as the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. In order to ensure uniformity among banks, closing rate to be applied for the purposes of AS 11 (revised 2003) for the relevant accounting period would be the last closing spot rate of exchange announced by FEDAI for that accounting period. (IV) Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR) In the context of recognition of gains in profit and loss account from FCTR on repatriation of accumulated profits/retained earnings from overseas branch(es), it is clarified that the repatriation of accumulated profits shall not be considered as disposal or partial disposal of interest in non-integral foreign operations as per AS 11. Accordingly, banks shall not recognise in the profit and loss account the proportionate exchange gains or losses held in the foreign currency translation reserve on repatriation of profits from overseas operations.

KMP are the whole-time directors for an Indian bank and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for a foreign bank having branches in India. Relatives of KMP would be on the lines indicated in section 45 S of the RBI Act, 1934 ii) The name and nature of related party relationship shall be disclosed, irrespective of whether there have been transactions, where control exists within the meaning of the Standard. Control would normally exist in case of parent-subsidiary relationship. The disclosures may be limited to aggregate for each of the above related party categories and would pertain to the year-end position as also the maximum position during the year. iii) The Accounting Standards is applicable to all nationalised banks. The accounting standard exempts state-controlled enterprises i.e., nationalised banks from making any disclosures pertaining to their transactions with other related parties which are also state controlled enterprises. Thus, nationalised banks need not disclose their transactions with the subsidiaries as well as the RRBs sponsored by them. However, they will be required to disclose their transactions with other related parties. - 46 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) iv) Secrecy provisions: If in any of the above category of related parties there is only one related party entity, any disclosure would tantamount to infringement of customer confidentiality. In terms of AS 18, the disclosure requirements do not apply in circumstances when providing such disclosures would conflict with the reporting enterprise’s duties of confidentiality as specifically required in terms of statute, by regulator or similar competent authority. Further, in case a statute or regulator governing an enterprise prohibits the enterprise from disclosing certain information, which is required to be disclosed, non-disclosure of such information would not be deemed as non- compliance with the Accounting Standards. On account of the judicially recognized common law duty of the banks to maintain the confidentiality of the customer details, they need not make such disclosures. In view of the above, where the disclosures under the Accounting Standards are not aggregated disclosures in respect of any category of related party i.e., where there is only one entity in any category of related party, banks need not disclose any details pertaining to that related party other than the relationship with that related party.

CFS This Accounting Standard sets out principles and procedures for recognizing, in the CFS, the effects of the investments in associates on the financial position and operating results of a group. The Standard requires that an investment in an associate shall be accounted for in CFS under the equity method subject to certain exceptions. The term associate is defined as an enterprise in which the investor has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture of the investor. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and/ or operating policy decisions of the investee but not control over those policies. Such an influence may be gained by share ownership, statute or agreement. As regards share ownership, if an investor holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries 20 per cent or more of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the investor has significant influence, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Conversely, if the investor holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries less than 20 per cent of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the investor does not have significant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated. A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an investor from having significant influence. The issue is whether conversion of debt into equity in an enterprise by a bank by virtue of which the bank holds more than 20 percent will result in an investor- associate relationship for the purpose of AS 23. From the above it is clear that - 47 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) though a bank may acquire more than 20 per cent of voting power in the borrower entity in satisfaction of its advances it may be able to demonstrate that it does not have the power to exercise significant influence since the rights exercised by it are protective in nature and not participative. In such a circumstance, such investment may not be treated as investment in associate under this Accounting Standard. Hence the test shall not be merely the proportion of investment but the intention to acquire the power to exercise significant influence.

7. Accounting Standard 24 - Discontinuing operations This Standard establishes principles for reporting information about discontinuing operations. Merger/ closure of branches of banks by transferring the assets/ liabilities to the other branches of the same bank may not be deemed as a discontinuing operation and hence this Accounting Standard will not be applicable to merger / closure of branches of banks by transferring the assets/ liabilities to the other branches of the same bank. Disclosures shall be required under the Standard only when: (i) discontinuing of the operation has resulted in shedding of liability and realisation of the assets by the bank or decision to discontinue an operation which will have the above effect has been finalised by the bank and (ii) the discontinued operation is substantial in its entirety.

8. Accounting Standard 25 – Interim Financial Reporting This Standard prescribes the minimum content of an interim financial report and the principles for recognition and measurement in a complete or condensed financial statements for an interim period. The disclosures required to be made by listed banks in terms of the listing agreements would not tantamount to interim reporting as envisaged under AS 25 and as such AS 25 is not mandatory for the quarterly reporting prescribed for listed banks. The recognition and measurement principles laid down under AS 25 shall however, be complied with in respect of such quarterly reports.

9. Accounting Standard 26 – Intangible asset This Standard prescribes the accounting treatment for intangible assets that are not dealt with specifically in another accounting standard. With respect to - 48 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks) computer software which has been customized for the bank’s use and is expected to be in use for some time, the detailed recognition and amortization principle in respect of computer software prescribed in the Standard adequately addresses these issues and may be followed by banks. It may be noted that intangible assets recognized and carried in the balance sheet of banks in compliance with AS 26 shall attract provisions of section 15(1) of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, in terms of which banks are prohibited from declaring any dividend until any expenditure not represented by tangible assets is carried in the balance sheet. Banks desirous of paying dividend while carrying any intangible assets in its books must seek exemption from section 15(1) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 from the Central Government.

10. Accounting Standard 27 - Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures This Standard is applied in accounting for interests in joint ventures and the reporting of joint venture assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the financial statements of ventures and investors, regardless of the structures or forms under which the joint venture activities take place. This Standard identifies three broad types of joint ventures, namely, jointly controlled operations, jointly controlled assets and jointly controlled entities. In case of jointly controlled entities, where banks are required to present CFS, the investment in joint ventures shall be accounted for as per provisions of this standard. In respect of joint ventures in the form of jointly controlled operations and jointly controlled assets, this Accounting Standard is applicable for both solo financial statements as well as CFS. It is clarified that though paragraph 26 of the Accounting Standard prescribes that for the purpose of solo financial statements, investment in jointly controlled entities is to be accounted as per Accounting Standard 13, such investment is to be reflected in the solo financial statements of banks as per guidelines prescribed by Reserve Bank of India since Accounting Standard 13 does not apply to banks. RRBs sponsored by banks shall be treated as associates and AS 27 shall not apply for investment in RRBs. The investment in RRBs shall however, be accounted in the consolidated financial statements as per the provisions of Accounting Standard 23. - 49 - Annex II (Applicable to commercial banks)

11. Accounting Standard 28 – Impairment of assets This standard prescribes the procedures that an enterprise applies to ensure that its assets are carried at no more than their recoverable amount. It is clarified that the standard shall not apply to inventories, investments and other financial assets such as loans and advances and shall generally be applicable to banks in so far as it relates to fixed assets. The Standard shall generally apply to financial lease assets and non-banking assets acquired in settlement of claims only when the indications of impairment of the entity are evident. - 50 - Annex III Disclosure in financial statements – ‘Notes to Accounts’ Annex III Disclosure in financial statements – ‘Notes to Accounts’ A. General The items listed in these Directions shall be disclosed in the ‘Notes to Accounts’ to the financial statements. Banks shall make additional disclosures where material. B. Presentation In addition to the schedules to the Balance Sheet, a summary of ‘Significant Accounting Policies’ and ‘Notes to Accounts’ shall be disclosed as separate Schedules. C. Disclosure requirements Banks shall, at the minimum, furnish the following information in the ‘Notes to Accounts’.

RRBs, LABs and Co-operative Banks may omit those line items/disclosures which are not applicable/permitted or with no exposure/ transaction both in the current year and previous year. Banks shall disclose comparative information in respect of the previous period for all amounts reported in the current period’s financial statements. Further, banks shall include comparative information for narrative and descriptive information if it is relevant to understanding the current period’s financial statements. Out of disclosure requirements specified in this Annex, disclosures outlined in Annex III-A shall be mandatory for RCBs from the year ending March 31, 2024.

Savings Bank (10 per cent) and Current (15 per cent) Deposits are generally withdrawable on demand. This portion may be treated as volatile. While volatile portion can be placed in the Day 1, 2-7 days and 8-14 days time buckets, depending upon the experience and estimates of banks and the core portion may be placed in over 1- 3 years bucket. This classification of Savings Bank and Current Deposits is only a benchmark. Banks which are better equipped to estimate the behavioural pattern, roll-in and roll-out, embedded options, etc. on the basis of past data / empirical studies could classify them in the appropriate buckets, i.e. behavioural maturity instead of contractual maturity, subject to the approval of the Board / ALCO - 53 - Annex III Disclosure in financial statements – ‘Notes to Accounts’ (Amount in ₹ crore) Quarter ended (Similarly, there will be column of each of the four quarters) Total Un-weighted1 Total Weighted2 Value (average) Value (average) High Quality Liquid Assets Total High-Quality Liquid Assets 1

3. Adjusted values shall be calculated after the application of both (i) haircuts and inflow and outflow rates and (ii) any applicable caps (i.e. cap on Level 2B and Level 2 assets for HQLA and cap on inflows). Data must be presented as simple averages of daily observations over the previous quarter (i.e. the average is calculated over a period of 90 days). Banks must publish the number of data points used in calculating the average figures in template. The simple average shall be calculated on daily observations over the previous quarters. For most data items, both un-weighted and weighted values of the LCR components shall be disclosed as given in the disclosure format. The un-weighted value of inflows and outflows shall be calculated as the outstanding balances of various categories or types of liabilities, off balance sheet items or contractual receivables. The weighted value of HQLA shall be calculated as the value after haircuts are applied. The weighted value for inflows and outflows shall be calculated as the value after the inflow and outflow rates are applied. Total HQLA and total net cash outflows shall be disclosed as the adjusted value, where the adjusted value of HQLA is the value of total HQLA after the application of both haircuts and any applicable caps on Level 2B and Level 2 assets as indicated in this Framework. The adjusted value of net cash outflows is to be calculated after the cap on inflows is applied, if applicable. ii) Banks shall provide sufficient qualitative discussion10 around the LCR to facilitate understanding of the results and data provided. 10 For example, where significant to the LCR, banks could discuss: a) the main drivers of their LCR results and the evolution of the contribution of inputs to the LCR’s calculation over time; b) intra period changes as well as changes over time; c) the composition of HQLA; d) concentration of funding sources; e) derivative exposures and potential collateral calls; f) currency mismatch in the LCR; g) a description of the degree of centralization of liquidity management and interaction between the group’s units; and other inflows and outflows in the LCR calculation that are not captured in the LCR common template but which the institution considers to be relevant for its liquidity profile. - 55 - Annex III Disclosure in financial statements – ‘Notes to Accounts’ c) Net Stable Funding ratio (NSFR)11 (Not Applicable to RRBs, LABs, PBs and Co-operative Banks) i) After the guidelines on NSFR become effective, Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs, LABs, and PBs) shall be required to publish their NSFRs as per template given below. ii) Banks shall publish this disclosure along with the publication of their financial statements/ results (i.e. typically quarterly or semi-annually), irrespective of whether the financial statements/ results are audited.
