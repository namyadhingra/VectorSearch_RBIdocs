CHAPTER – I PRELIMINARY 1. Short Title and Commencement. (a) These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy for Local Area Banks) Directions, 2021. (b) These directions shall come into effect from October 26, 2021. 2. Applicability The provisions of these Directions shall apply to all Local Area Banks, licensed to operate in India by the Reserve Bank of India. 3. Purpose This Master Direction covers instructions regarding the components of capital and the capital required to be provided for by banks for credit and market risks. These Directions serve to specify the prudential norms from the point of view of capital adequacy. Permission for LABs to undertake transactions in specific instruments/products shall be guided by the regulations, instructions and guidelines on the same issued by Reserve Bank from time to time. 4. Definitions

(a) In these Directions, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms herein shall bear the meanings assigned to them below — 1 i. “Basis Risk” is the risk that the interest rate of different assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items may change in different magnitude. ii. “Credit risk” is defined as the potential that a bank's borrower or counterparty may fail to meet its obligations in accordance with agreed terms. It is also the possibility of losses associated with diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties. iii. “Deferred Tax Assets” shall have the same meaning as assigned under the extant Accounting Standards. iv. “Derivative” shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in section 45U(a) of the RBI Act, 1934. v. “Duration” (Macaulay duration) measures the price volatility of fixed income securities. It is often used in the comparison of the interest rate risk between securities with different coupons and different maturities. It is the weighted average of the present value of all the cash flows associated with a fixed income security. It is expressed in years. The duration of a fixed income security is always shorter than its term to maturity, except in the case of zero coupon securities where they are the same. vi. “Hedging” is taking action to eliminate or reduce exposure to risk vii. “Horizontal Disallowance” is a disallowance of offsets to required capital used in the BIS (Bank of International Settlements) Method1 for assessing market risk for regulatory capital in order to calculate the capital required for interest rate risk of a trading portfolio. The BIS Method allows offsets of long and short positions. However, interest rate risks of instruments at different horizontal points of the yield curve are not perfectly correlated. Hence, the BIS Method requires that a portion of these offsets be disallowed. 1 Amendment to the Capital Accord to incorporate market risks: BCBS January 1996 2 viii. “Interest rate risk” is the risk that the financial value of assets or liabilities (or inflows/outflows) will be altered because of fluctuations in interest rates. ix. “Long Position” refers to a position where gains arise from a rise in the value of the underlying. x. “Market risk” is the risk of losses in on-and off-balfance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. xi. “Modified Duration” or volatility of an interest-bearing security is its Macaulay Duration divided by one plus the coupon rate of the security. It represents the percentage change in the securities' price for a 100 basis points change in yield. It is generally accurate for only small changes in the yield. MD = - dP /dY x 1/P Where, MD= Modified Duration P= Gross price (i.e. clean price plus accrued interest) dP= Corresponding small change in price dY = Small change in yield compounded with the frequency of the coupon payment. xii. “Mortgage-backed security” is a bond-type security in which the collateral is provided by a pool of mortgages. Income from the underlying mortgages is used to meet interest and principal repayments. xiii. “Open position” is the net difference between the amounts payable and amounts receivable in a particular instrument or commodity. It results from the existence of a net long or net short position in the particular instrument or commodity. xiv. “Short position” refers to a position where gains arise from a decline in the value of the underlying. It also refers to the sale of a security in which the seller does not have a long position. 3 xv. “Vertical Disallowance” in the method for determining regulatory capital necessary to cushion market risk is a reversal of the offsets of a general risk charge of a long position by a short position in two or more securities in the same time band in the yield curve where the securities have differing credit risks.

CHAPTER – II COMPOSITION OF REGULATORY CAPITAL 5. Banks are required to maintain a minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9 per cent on an ongoing basis. 6.

(iv) Investments in the instruments issued by banks / FIs which are listed at paragraph 14(ii) above, which are not deducted from capital of the investing bank/ FI, shall attract 100 per cent risk weight for credit risk for capital adequacy purposes.

(v) An indicative list of institutions which may be deemed to be financial institutions for capital adequacy purposes is as under:  Banks,  Mutual funds,  Insurance companies,  Non-banking financial companies,  Housing finance companies,  Merchant banking companies,  Primary dealers 7 (vi) The following investments shall be excluded from the purview of the ceiling of 10 per cent prudential norm prescribed in paragraph 14(i) above: a) Investments in equity shares of other banks /FIs in India held under the provisions of a statute. b) Strategic investments in equity shares of other banks/FIs incorporated outside India as promoters/significant shareholders (i.e., Foreign Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures / Associates). c) Equity holdings outside India in other banks / FIs incorporated outside India.

15. Capital Charge for Subsidiaries A consolidated bank defined as a group of entities which include a licensed bank shall maintain a minimum Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) as applicable to the parent bank on an ongoing basis. The parent bank shall consider the following points while computing capital funds: i. Banks shall maintain a minimum capital to risk weighted assets ratio of 9%. Non-bank subsidiaries shall maintain the capital adequacy ratio prescribed by their respective regulators. In case of any shortfall in the capital adequacy ratio of any of the subsidiaries, the parent shall maintain capital in addition to its own regulatory requirements to cover the shortfall. ii. Risks inherent in deconsolidated entities in the group shall be assessed and any shortfall in the regulatory capital in the deconsolidated entities shall be deducted (in equal proportion from Tier I and Tier II capital) from the consolidated bank's capital in the proportion of its equity stake in the entity. CHAPTER – III Capital Charge for Credit Risk

16. Banks shall manage the credit risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure that the capital requirements for credit risks are maintained on a continuous basis, at the close of each business day. The applicable risk weights for calculation of CRAR for credit risk are specified in Annex 6. 8 CHAPTER – IV Capital Charge for Market Risk 17. Scope and Coverage of Capital Charge for Market Risks The capital charge for market risk shall cover the capital charges for interest rate related instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and foreign exchange risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both trading and banking books. Trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy shall include all instruments5 that are classified as “Held for Trading” as per Master Direction - Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks (Directions), 2023 dated September 12, 2023. All other instruments6 shall be included in the banking book and attract corresponding capital charge for credit risk (or counterparty credit risk, where applicable).

18. Banks shall manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure that the capital requirements for market risks are maintained on a continuous basis, at the close of each business day. Banks shall also maintain strict risk management systems to monitor and control intra-day exposures to market risks. 19. Measurement of Capital Charge for Interest Rate Risk in Trading Book other than Derivatives The capital charge for interest rate related instruments shall apply to the fair value of these items in bank’s trading book. The fair value shall be determined as per the extant RBI guidelines on valuation of investments. The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separate capital charges:-

(i) Specific risk charge for each security both for short and long positions (ii) General market risk charge towards interest rate risk in the portfolio where long and short positions in different securities or instruments can be offset. 5 At present, LABs are not permitted to carry out activities involving foreign exchange or derivative positions. However, as and when these activities are allowed, the relevant instructions would become applicable to them. 6 Accordingly, instruments classified under HTM, AFS, FVTPL (non-HFT) and investments in own subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates shall also be part of banking book and will not attract market risk capital charge. 9 In India short position is not allowed except in case of derivatives and Central Government Securities. Banks shall follow the framework specified hereunder for capital charge for both specific risk and general market risk for interest rate risk in the trading book other than derivatives.

20. Specific Risk The capital charge for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse movement in the price of an individual security owing to factors related to the individual issuer. The specific risk charge is graduated for various exposures under three heads: (a) claims on Government, (b) claims on banks, (c) claims on others as specified in Annex 7. 21. General Market Risk (a) The capital charge for general market risk is designed to capture the risk of loss arising from changes in market interest rates. The capital charge shall be the sum of three components:  the net short ( short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central Government Securities) or long position in the whole trading book;  a small proportion of the matched positions in each time-band (the “vertical disallowance”); and  a larger proportion of the matched positions across different time-bands (the “horizontal disallowance”).

(b) Banks shall adopt the standardized duration method for computation of capital charge for market risk. Banks shall be required to measure the general market risk charge by calculating the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each position separately. The mechanics shall be as follows:  first calculate the price sensitivity (modified duration) of each instrument;  next apply the assumed change in yield to the modified duration of each instrument between 0.6 and 1.0 percentage points depending on the maturity of the instrument as specified in Annex 8;  slot the resulting capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the fifteen time bands as specified in Annex 8; 10  subject long and short positions in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical disallowance designed to capture basis risk; and  carry forward the net positions in each time-band for horizontal offsetting subject to the disallowances specified in Annex 9.

22. Capital Charge for Interest Rate Derivatives The measurement of capital charge for market risk shall include all interest rate derivatives and off-balance sheet instruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates (eg. Forward rate agreements, other forward contracts, etc.) and derivatives entered into for hedging trading book exposures. The details of measurement of capital charge for interest rate derivatives are specified in Annex 10. 23. Measurement of Capital Charge for equities in the trading book

(a) Capital charge for equities in the trading book shall be applied to all instruments that exhibit market behavior similar to equities but not to non-convertible preference shares (which are covered by the interest rate risk requirements). The instruments covered include equity shares, whether voting or non-voting, convertible securities that behave like equities, such as units of mutual funds, and commitments to buy or sell equity. The capital charge for equities shall apply to the fair value of these items in the bank’s trading book. Capital charge for specific risk (akin to credit risk) shall be 11.25%. Specific risk shall be computed on the banks’ gross equity positions (the sum of all long equity positions and of all short equity positions-short equity position is, however, not allowed for banks in India). The general market risk charge shall be 9% on the gross equity positions.

(b) Investments in shares and units of Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) shall be assigned 150% risk weight for measuring the credit risk when these are held under banking book. When these are held under or transferred to trading book, the capital charge for specific risk component of the market risk shall be fixed at 13.5% to reflect the risk weight of 150%. The charge for general market risk component shall be at 9% as in the case of other equities. 11 24. Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange and Gold Open Positions Foreign exchange open positions and gold open positions shall be risk weighted at 100%. Capital charge for foreign exchange and gold open positions (limits or actual whichever is higher) shall attract capital charge at 9%.

25. Aggregation of Capital Charge for Market Risks The capital charges for specific risk and general market risk shall be computed separately before aggregation. For computing the total capital charge for market risks, the calculations shall be plotted in the proforma as per Table 1 below. Table-1: Total Capital Charge for Market Risk (₹ crore) Risk Category Capital charge I. Interest Rate (a+b) a. General market risk  Net position (parallel shift)  Horizontal disallowance (curvature)  Vertical disallowance (basis) b. Specific risk II. Equity (a+b) a. General Market Risk b. Specific Risk III. Foreign Exchange & Gold IV. Total capital charge for market risks (I+II+III) 26. Computation of Capital available for Market Risk: Capital required for supporting credit risk shall be deducted from total capital funds to arrive at capital available for supporting market risk. (Refer Annex 11 for illustration).

27. Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposures7: Exposures to entities with unhedged foreign currency exposures shall attract incremental capital requirements (i.e., over and above the present capital requirements) as under: Potential Loss/EBID (%) Incremental Capital Requirement Up to 75 per cent 0 More than 75 per cent 25 percentage point8increase in the risk weight 7 Please refer to Reserve Bank of India (Unhedged Foreign Currency Exposure) Directions, 2022 issued vide DOR.MRG.REC.76/00-00-007/2022-23 dated October 11, 2022. 8 For example: for an entity which otherwise attracts a risk weight of 50 per cent, the applicable risk weight would become 75 per cent. 12 CHAPTER – V Calculation of Total Risk-Weighted Assets and Capital Ratio

28. The following steps shall be followed for calculation of total risk weighted assets and capital ratio: i) Compute the risk weighted assets for credit risk in the banking book and for counterparty credit risk on all OTC derivatives. ii) Convert the capital charge for market risk to notional risk weighted assets by multiplying the capital charge arrived at in Table 1 above, by 100 ÷ 9 [the present requirement of CRAR is 9% and hence notional risk weighted assets are arrived at by multiplying the capital charge by (100 ÷ 9)] iii) Add the risk-weighted assets for credit risk as at (i) above and notional risk- weighted assets of trading book as at (ii) above to arrive at total risk weighted assets for the bank. iv) Compute capital ratio on the basis of regulatory capital maintained and risk- weighted assets. 29. Worked out Examples: Two examples for computing capital charge for market risk and credit risk are given in Annex 12. CHAPTER – VI REPEAL AND OTHER PROVISIONS 30.

All other assets # 100 Notes #: (i) The exposures to CCPs on account of derivatives trading and securities financing transactions (e.g. Repos) outstanding against them, will be assigned 41 zero exposure value for counterparty credit risk, as it is presumed that the CCPs' exposures to their counterparties are fully collateralised on a daily basis, thereby providing protection for the CCP's credit risk exposures; (ii) The deposits / collaterals kept by banks with the CCPs will attract risk weights appropriate to the nature of the CCP. In the case of CCIL, the risk weight will be 20 per cent. *: It is possible for an exposure to get classified simultaneously into more than one category, as different classifications are driven by different considerations. In such cases, the exposure shall be reckoned for regulatory / prudential exposure limit, if any, fixed by RBI or by the bank itself, for all the categories to which the exposure is assigned. For the purpose of capital adequacy, the largest of the risk weights applicable among all the categories would be applicable for the exposure. @: Commercial Real Estate – Residential Housing (CRE-RH) shall consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption) under CRE segment. Such projects shall ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate. However, integrated housing projects comprising of some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, etc.) can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing projects does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans shall be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH. Banks’ exposure to third dwelling unit onwards to an individual shall also be treated as CRE exposures. 42 B. Off-Balance Sheet items The credit risk exposure attached to Off-Balance Sheet items shall be first calculated by multiplying the face value of each of the Off-Balance Sheet items by ‘Credit Conversion Factor’ as indicated in the table below. This shall then have to be again multiplied by the weights attributable to the relevant counter-party as specified in ‘A’ above. Sr. Instruments Credit No. Conversion Factor

Bills discounted by banks which have been accepted by another bank will be treated as a funded claim on a bank. In all the above cases banks should be fully satisfied that the risk exposure is in fact on the other bank. C. While calculating the aggregate of funded and non-funded exposure of a borrower for the purpose of assignment of risk weight, banks shall ‘net-off’ against the total outstanding exposure of the borrower -

(a) advances collateralised by cash margins or deposits; (b) credit balances in current or other accounts which are not earmarked for specific purposes and free from any lien; (c) Provisions for depreciation or for bad debts made in respect of any assets; (d) claims received from DICGC/ ECGC and kept in a separate account pending adjustment; and (e) subsidies received against advances in respect of Government sponsored schemes and kept in a separate account. 44 D.

Risk Weights for Forward Rate Agreement (FRA) /Interest Rate Swap (IRS) and Foreign Exchange Contracts 1. Foreign exchange contracts include - Cross currency swaps, Forward foreign exchange contracts, Currency futures and other contracts of a similar nature.

2. Foreign exchange contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less, irrespective of the counterparty, shall be assigned "zero" risk weight. However, in case effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in paragraph E-4 of this Annex are in place, this exemption to foreign exchange contracts with an original maturity of 14 calendar days or less would not be applicable.

3. For reckoning the minimum capital ratio, the computation of risk weighted assets on account of FRAs / IRS and Foreign Exchange Contracts shall be done as per the two steps procedure set out below: a) Step 1: The notional principal amount of each instrument shall be multiplied by the conversion factor given below: Conversion Factor Original Maturity Interest rate Foreign exchange contracts contracts Less than one year 0.5 per cent 2.0 per cent One year and less than two years 1.0 per cent 5.0 per cent For each additional year 1.0 per cent 3.0 per cent 45 When effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in paragraph E-4 of this Annex are in place, the conversion factors, as mentioned in the below table, shall be applicable10: Conversion Factor Original Maturity Interest rate Foreign exchange contracts contracts Less than one year 0.35 per cent 1.5 per cent One year and less than two years 0.75 per cent 3.75 per cent For each additional year 0.75 per cent 2.25 per cent b) Step 2: The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weightage allotted to the relevant counter-party as specified below: Counter party Risk weight Banks 20 per cent Central & State Govt. 0 per cent All others 100 per cent

4. Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract: (a) Banks may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between a bank and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations. (b) Banks may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting not covered in (a), including other forms of novation. (c) In both cases (a) and (b), a bank will need to satisfy that it has:

(i) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single 10 For purposes of calculating the credit exposure to a netting counterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, the original credit conversion factors (i.e., without considering the impact of bilateral netting) should be applied to the notional principal, which is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. In no case should the reduced factors above be applied to net notional amounts. 46 legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that the bank would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances. (ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under:  The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;  The law that governs the individual transactions; and  The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting. (iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.

(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose of calculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A walkaway clause is a provision which permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make only limited payments or no payment at all, to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor. 47 Annex 6.1 MSE Advances Guaranteed by Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) – Risk weights (Paragraph (A)(III)(9) of Annex 6) Risk-Weight Example I CGTMSE Cover: 75% of the amount outstanding or 75% of the unsecured amount or ₹18.75 lakh, whichever is less Realisable value of Security : ₹1 .50 lakh a) Balance outstanding : ₹10.00 lakh b) Realisable value of security : ₹1.50 lakh c) Unsecured amount (a) - (b) : ₹8.50 lakh d) Guaranteed portion (75% of (c)) : ₹6.38 lakh e) Uncovered portion (8.50 lakh – 6.38 lakh) : ₹2.12 lakh Risk-weight on (b) and (e) – Linked to the counter party Risk-weight on (d) – Zero Example II CGTMSE cover: 75% of the amount outstanding or 75% of the unsecured amount or ₹18.75 lakh whichever is less Realisable value of Security : ₹10.00 lakh. a) Balance outstanding : ₹40.00 lakh b) Realisable value of security : ₹10.00 lakh c) Unsecured amount (a) - (b) : ₹30.00 lakh d) Guaranteed portion (max.) : ₹18.75 lakh e) Uncovered portion (`30 lakh-18.75 lakh) : ₹11.25lakh Risk-weight (b) and (e) - Linked to the counter party Risk-weight on (d) - Zero ****** 48 Annex 6.2 Terms and conditions for the purpose of Liberal Risk Weight for Capital Adequacy for investments in Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) of residential assets of Housing Finance Companies (HFC) (Vide item (A)(II)(12)of Annex 6) 1(a) The right, title and interest of a HFC in securitized housing loans and receivables there under should irrevocably be assigned in favour of a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) / Trust. 1(b) Mortgaged securities underlying the securitized housing loans should be held exclusively on behalf of and for the benefit of the investors by the SPV/Trust. 1(c) The SPV or Trust shall be entitled to the receivables under the securitised loans with an arrangement for distribution of the same to the investors as per the terms of issue of MBS.

In the case of those currencies in which business is insignificant (where the turnover in the respective currency is less than 5 per cent of overall foreign exchange turnover), separate calculations for each currency are not required. The bank can, instead, slot within each appropriate time-band, the net long or short position for each currency. However, these individual net positions shall be summed within each time-band, irrespective of whether they are long or short positions, to produce a gross position figure. In the case of residual currencies, the gross positions in each time-band shall be subject to the assumed change in yield set out in table with no further offsets. 56 Annex 10 Measurement system in respect of Interest Rate Derivatives

1. Interest Rate Derivatives The measurement system shall include all interest rate derivatives and off-balance sheet instruments in the trading book, which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. forward rate agreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and cross-currency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions).

2. Calculation of positions The derivatives shall be converted into positions in the relevant underlying and be subjected to specific and general market risk charges. In computation of the capital charge, the amounts reported shall be the market value of the principal amount of the underlying or of the notional underlying. For instruments where the apparent notional amount differs from the effective notional amount, banks shall use the effective notional amount. i. Futures and forward contracts, including Forward Rate Agreements (FRA): These instruments shall be treated as a combination of a long and a short position in a notional government security. The maturity of a future or a FRA shall be the period until delivery or exercise of the contract, plus - where applicable - the life of the underlying instrument. For example, a long position in a June three-month interest rate future (taken in April) shall be reported as a long position in a government security with a maturity of five months and a short position in a government security with a maturity of two months. Where a range of deliverable instruments may be delivered to fulfill the contract, the bank has flexibility to elect which deliverable security goes into the duration ladder but shall take account of any conversion factor defined by the exchange. ii. Swaps: Swaps shall be treated as two notional positions in government securities with relevant maturities. For example, an interest rate swap under which a bank is receiving floating rate interest and paying fixed will be treated as a long position in a floating rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the period until the next interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to the residual life of the swap. For swaps that pay or receive a fixed or floating interest rate against some other reference price, e.g. a stock index, the 57 interest rate component shall be slotted into the appropriate re-pricing maturity category, with the equity component being included in the equity framework. Separate legs of cross-currency swaps shall be reported in the relevant maturity ladders for the currencies concerned.

3. Calculation of Capital Charges for Derivatives under the Standardised Methodology: i. Allowable offsetting of matched positions Banks shall exclude the following from the interest rate maturity framework altogether (for both specific and general market risk);  Long and short positions (both actual and notional) in identical instruments with exactly the same issuer, coupon, currency and maturity.  A matched position in a future or forward and its corresponding underlying shall also be fully offset (the leg representing the time to expiry of the future shall however be reported) and thus excluded from the calculation. When the future or the forward comprises a range of deliverable instruments, offsetting of positions in the future or forward contract and its underlying is only permissible in cases where there is a readily identifiable underlying security which is most profitable for the trader with a short position to deliver. The price of this security, sometimes called the "cheapest-to-deliver", and the price of the future or forward contract shall in such cases move in close alignment. No offsetting shall be allowed between positions in different currencies; the separate legs of cross-currency swaps or forward foreign exchange deals shall be treated as notional positions in the relevant instruments and included in the appropriate calculation for each currency. In addition, opposite positions in the same category of instruments can in certain circumstances be regarded as matched and allowed to offset fully. To qualify for this treatment the positions shall relate to the same underlying instruments, be of the same nominal value and be denominated in the same currency. In addition:  for futures: offsetting positions in the notional or underlying instruments to which the futures contract relates shall be for identical products and mature within seven days of each other; 58  for swaps and FRAs: the reference rate (for floating rate positions) shall be identical and the coupon closely matched (i.e. within 15 basis points); and  for swaps, FRAs and forwards: the next interest fixing date or, for fixed coupon positions or forwards, the residual maturity shall correspond within the following limits: o less than one month hence: same day; o between one month and one year hence: within seven days; o over one year hence: within thirty days. Banks with large swap books can use alternative formulae for these swaps to calculate the positions to be included in the duration ladder. The method shall be to calculate the sensitivity of the net present value implied by the change in yield used in the duration method and allocate these sensitivities into the time-bands specified in Annex 8. ii. Specific Risk Interest rate and currency swaps, FRAs, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate futures shall not be subject to a specific risk charge. This exemption also applies to futures on an interest rate index. However, in the case of futures contracts where the underlying is a debt security, or an index representing a basket of debt securities, a specific risk charge shall apply according to the credit risk of the issuer. iii. General Market Risk General market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in the same manner as for cash positions, subject only to an exemption for fully or very closely matched positions in identical instruments as defined in paragraphs above. The various categories of instruments shall be slotted into the maturity ladder and treated according to the rules identified earlier. 59 Table - Summary of treatment of interest rate derivatives Instrument Specific General Market risk risk charge charge Exchange-traded future - Government debt security No Yes, as two positions - Corporate debt security Yes Yes, as two positions - Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR) No Yes, as two positions OTC forward - Government debt security No Yes, as two positions - Corporate debt security Yes Yes, as two positions - Index on interest rates (e.g. MIBOR) No Yes, as two positions FRAs, Swaps No Yes, as two positions Forward Foreign Exchange No Yes, as one position in each currency 60 Annex 11 Computation of Capital for Market Risk Capital required for supporting credit risk shall be deducted from total capital funds to arrive at capital available for supporting market risk as illustrated below: (₹ in crore) 1 Capital funds 105  Tier I capital ------------------------------- 55  Tier II capital ------------------------------ 50 2 Total risk weighted assets 1140  RWA for credit risk ----------------------- 1000  RWA for market risk --------------------- 140 3 Total CRAR 9.21 4 Minimum capital required to support credit risk (1000*9%) 90  Tier I - 45 (@ 4.5% of 1000) ---------- 45  Tier II - 45 (@ 4.5% of 1000) --------- 45 5 Capital available to support market risk (105 - 90) 15  Tier I - (55 - 45) -------------------------- 10 5  Tier II - (50 - 45) ------------------------- 61 Annex 12 Worked out examples for computing Capital Charge for Credit and Market Risks Example I - Case where the trading book does not contain equities and interest rate related derivative instruments

Total Charge for Market Risk Adding the capital charges for specific risk as well as general market risk would give the total capital charge for the trading book of interest rate related instruments. Therefore, capital charge for Market Risks = ₹32.33 crore + ₹17.82 crore, i.e., ₹50.15 crore. d. To facilitate computation of CRAR for the whole book, this capital charge needs to be converted into equivalent risk weighted assets. In India, the minimum CRAR is 9%. Hence, the capital charge could be converted to risk weighted assets by multiplying the capital charge by (100 ÷ 9), Thus risk weighted assets for market risk is 50.15*(100 ÷ 9) = ₹557.23 crore.

Long and short positions within a time band have been subjected to vertical disallowance of 5%. In the instant case, vertical disallowance is applicable under 3-6 month time band and 7.3- 9.3 year time band. Then, net positions in each time band have been computed for horizontal offsetting subject to the disallowances mentioned in the table. In the instant case, horizontal disallowance is applicable only in respect of Zone 3. Horizontal disallowances in respect of adjacent zones are not applicable in the instant case.

3.1 Calculation of Vertical Disallowance While calculating capital charge for general market risk on interest rate related instruments, banks should recognize the basis risk (different types of instruments whose price responds differently for movement in general rates) and gap risk (different maturities within timebands). This is addressed by a small capital charge (5%) on matched (off-setting) positions in each time band (“Vertical Disallowance”) An off-setting position, for vertical disallowance, will be either the sum of long positions and or the short positions within a time band, whichever is lower. In the table at the end of the annex, except for the time band 3-6 months in Zone 1 and the time band of

7.3-9.3 years, where there are off-setting positions of (-) 0.22 and 2.79, there is no offsetting position in any other time band. The sum of long positions in the 3-6 months time band is + 0.47 and the sum of short positions in this time band is (-) 0.22. This offsetting position of 0.22 is subjected to a capital charge of 5% i.e. 0.01. The sum of long positions in the 7.3-9.3 years time band is + 2.79 and the sum of short positions in this time band is (-) 3.08. This off-setting position of 2.79 is subjected to a capital 72 charge of 5% i.e. 0.1395. It may be mentioned here that if a bank does not have both long and short positions in the same time band, there is no need for any vertical disallowance. Banks in India are not allowed to take any short position in their books, except in derivatives. Therefore, banks in India will generally not be subject to vertical disallowance unless they have a short position in derivatives.

3.2. Calculation of Horizontal Disallowance While calculating capital charge for general market risk on interest rate related instruments, banks must subject their positions to a second round of off-setting across time bands with a view to give recognition to the fact that interest rate movements are not perfectly correlated across maturity bands (yield curve risk and spread risk) i.e matched long and short positions in different time bands may not perfectly off-set. This is achieved by a “Horizontal Disallowance”. An off-setting position, for horizontal disallowance, will be either the sum of long positions and or the short positions within a Zone, whichever is lower. In the above example, except in Zone 3 (7.3 to 9.3 years) where there is an off-setting (matched) position of (-) 0.29, there is no off-setting position in any other Zone. The sum of long positions in this Zone is 9.74 and the sum of short positions in this Zone is (-) 0.29. This off-setting position of 0.29 is subject to horizontal disallowance as under: Within the same Zone (Zone 3) 30% of 0.29 = 0.09 Between adjacent Zones (Zone 2 & 3) = Nil Between Zones 1 and Zone 3 = Nil It may be mentioned here that if a bank does not have both long and short positions in different time zones, there is no need for any horizontal disallowance. Banks in India are not allowed to take any short position in their books except in derivatives. Therefore, banks in India will generally not be subject to horizontal disallowance unless they have short positions in derivatives. Total capital charge for interest rate related instruments is shown below: For overall net position 16.06 For vertical disallowance 0.15 For horizontal disallowance in Zone 3 0.09 For horizontal disallowance in adjacent zones nil For horizontal disallowance between Zone 1 & 3 Nil Total capital charge for interest rate related instruments 16.30 73 (4) The total capital charge in this example for general market risk for interest rate related instruments is computed as under: Sl. Capital charge Amount No. (₹) 1 For the vertical disallowance (under 3-6 month time band) 1,12,500 2 For the vertical disallowance (under 7.3-9.3 year time band) 13,95,000 3 For the horizontal disallowance (under Zone 3) 9,00,000 4 For the horizontal disallowances between adjacent zones 0 5 For the overall net open position (17.82 – 2.61 + 0.84) 16,06,00,000 6 Total capital charge for general market risk on interest 16,30,07,500 rate related instruments (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) (5) Equities: Capital charge for General Market Risk for equities is 9%. Thus, general market risk capital charge on equities would work out to ₹27 crore. (6) Forex / Gold Open Position Capital charge on forex/gold position would be computed at 9%. Thus, the same works out to ₹9 crore (7) Capital charge for market risks in this example is computed as under: (Amount in ₹ crore) Details Capital charge for Capital charge for Total Specific Risk General Market Risk Interest instruments 32.33 16.30 48.63 Rate Related Equities 27.00 27.00 54.00 Forex/Gold - 9.00 9.00 Total 59.33 52.30 111.63

2.3 Computing Capital Ratio To facilitate computation of CRAR for the whole book, this capital charge for market risks in the Trading Book needs to be converted into equivalent risk weighted assets. As in India, a CRAR of 9% is required, the capital charge could be converted to risk weighted assets by multiplying the capital charge by (100 ÷ 9), i.e. ₹111.63*(100 ÷ 9) = ₹1240.33 crore. Therefore, risk weighted assets for market risk is: ₹1240.33 crore.
