6.4 While calculating Net Bank Credit as above, if banks subtract prudential write off at Corporate/Head Office level, it shall be ensured that the credit to priority sector and all sub-sectors so written off shall also be subtracted category wise from priority sector target and sub-target achievement. Investments or any other items which are treated as eligible for classification under priority sector target/sub-target achievement, shall also form part of Adjusted Net Bank Credit. 6.5 All banks shall adhere to the respective licencing and operating guidelines issued by the Department of Regulation, RBI as updated from time to time. 7.

Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement

8.1 To address regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit at the district level, it was decided to rank districts on the basis of per capita credit flow to priority sector and build an incentive framework for districts with comparatively lower flow of credit and a dis-incentive framework for districts with comparatively higher flow of priority sector credit. With effect from FY 2024-25, a higher weight (125%) shall be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). The list of both categories of districts is given in Annexes IA and IB and will be valid up to FY 2026-27, subject to a review thereafter. The districts other than those mentioned in Annexes IA and IB will continue to have normal weightage of 100%.

8.2 The banks shall continue to report the actual outstanding amount in Quarterly Priority Sector Advances (QPSA) returns as hitherto. Adjustments for weights to incremental PSL credit will be done by RBI, based on reporting of district wise credit flow to FIDD, CO through the ADEPT database. RRBs, UCBs, LABs and foreign banks (including Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) would be exempted from adjustments of weights in PSL achievement due to their currently limited area of operation/catering to a niche segment.

Production of food grade packaging material such as laminates, tetra packs, bottles, tin containers etc. 35 Annex – IV COVID-19 measures - PSL treatment To mitigate the financial impact of COVID-19 related disruptions, RBI had taken several policy measures to ease the flow of credit to needy segments. Priority sector classification shall be available to outstanding credit extended under the measures specified below:

(i) In terms of press release: 2021-2022/177 dated May 7, 2021, an on-tap liquidity window of ₹50,000 crore with tenors of up to three years at the repo rate till March 31, 2022 was opened to boost provision of immediate liquidity for ramping up COVID-related healthcare infrastructure and services in the country. Banks were expected to create a COVID loan book under the scheme. Banks were advised to deliver these loans to borrowers directly or through intermediary financial entities regulated by the RBI. These loans will continue to be classified as priority sector lending till repayment or maturity, whichever is earlier. Banks which deployed their own resources without availing funds from the RBI under the scheme for lending to the specified segments mentioned above, are also eligible for the incentives stipulated as above. (ii) In terms of press release: 2021-2022/323 dated June 4, 2021, a separate liquidity window of ₹15,000 crore with tenors of up to three years at the repo rate till March 31, 2022 was opened for certain contact-intensive sectors i.e., hotels and restaurants; tourism - travel agents, tour operators and adventure/heritage facilities; aviation ancillary services - ground handling and supply chain; and other services that include private bus operators, car repair services, rent-a-car service providers, event/conference organisers, spa clinics, and beauty parlours/saloons. Banks were expected to create a separate COVID loan book under the scheme. Banks desirous of deploying their own resources without availing funds from the RBI under the scheme for lending to the specified segments mentioned above, were also eligible for this incentive. 36 Annex – V Priority Sector achievement - Calculation of shortfall/excess Illustration: Tables No.1 and 2 below illustrate the method followed for computation of shortfall/excess in priority sector target achievement at the end of the financial year under the revised PSL guidelines.

In Table – 2, the bank has overall excess of ₹2293 crore at the end of the financial year. The adjustments due to weightage on incremental credit in identified districts as per para 8, will be as per the data submitted by banks in the Automated Data Extraction Project (ADEPT). The same method will be followed for calculating the achievement of quarterly and yearly priority sector sub-targets. 37 Note: The computation of priority sector targets/sub-targets achievement will be based on the ANBC or Credit Equivalent Amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures, whichever is higher, as at the corresponding date of the preceding year. 38 Appendix List of Circulars Consolidated Sr. # Circular No. Date Subject 1 FIDD.CO.PSD.BC.No.12/ March 24, 2025 Priority Sector Lending
