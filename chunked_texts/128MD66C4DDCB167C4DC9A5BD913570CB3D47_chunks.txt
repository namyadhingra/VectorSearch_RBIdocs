6.4 While calculating Net Bank Credit as above, if banks subtract prudential write off at Corporate/Head Office level, it shall be ensured that the credit to priority sector and all sub-sectors so written off shall also be subtracted category wise from priority sector target and sub-target achievement. Investments or any other items which are treated as eligible for classification under priority sector target/sub-target achievement, shall also form part of Adjusted Net Bank Credit. 6.5 All banks shall adhere to the respective licencing and operating guidelines issued by the Department of Regulation, RBI as updated from time to time. 7.

Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement

8.1 To address regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit at the district level, it was decided to rank districts on the basis of per capita credit flow to priority sector and build an incentive framework for districts with comparatively lower flow of credit and a dis-incentive framework for districts with comparatively higher flow of priority sector credit. With effect from FY 2024-25, a higher weight (125%) shall be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). The list of both categories of districts is given in Annexes IA and IB and will be valid up to FY 2026-27, subject to a review thereafter. The districts other than those mentioned in Annexes IA and IB will continue to have normal weightage of 100%.

8.2 The banks shall continue to report the actual outstanding amount in Quarterly Priority Sector Advances (QPSA) returns as hitherto. Adjustments for weights to incremental PSL credit will be done by RBI, based on reporting of district wise credit flow to FIDD, CO through the ADEPT database. RRBs, UCBs, LABs and foreign banks (including Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) would be exempted from adjustments of weights in PSL achievement due to their currently limited area of operation/catering to a niche segment.
